WEBVTT

00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:12.435
But I feel like 

00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:17.214
They only let you put like two things in it though. 

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:21.901
yeah and it's a smaller bagel too it's not like a big bagel 

00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:24.222
 study bagel.

00:00:26.337 --> 00:00:28.417
oh oh oh oh oh oh

00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:30.588
Yeah, I don't know

00:00:36.743 --> 00:00:40.637
I don't think I'm going to be able to cook lunch for myself every day. 

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:45.518
Well, I was thinking oh to cook.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.759
mmm

00:00:51.643 --> 00:00:55.710
I know, but you have to prepare. That's exactly what I'm talking about.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.047
Well, yeah for sure

00:01:00.047 --> 00:01:03.625
But it's like still you're taking time to like prepare, you know?

00:01:04.786 --> 00:01:06.095
mmmm

00:01:06.813 --> 00:01:11.230
I feel like I was thinking like lunch. I let myself

00:01:11.114 --> 00:01:15.758
get stuff on campus, but keep that kind of night garden a bit on myself.

00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:19.606
Cuz like I've been surviving with that so like

00:01:19.606 --> 00:01:22.829
I'll just keep going in the same places I always go to for lunch.

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.824
And then, well, I've been doing it same order

00:01:29.398 --> 00:01:32.583
But like your paying for your swipes excessive paying

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:35.771
oh yeah I'm not paying for my own food

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.739
Sorry, I don't, I don't pay for my food.

00:01:39.662 --> 00:01:43.753
Like next year, I don't think I'm paying for my food Yeah.

00:01:44.934 --> 00:01:48.543
Yeah, I was shocked. Ren said he pays for his groceries. 

00:01:50.553 --> 00:01:55.895
But like he he has to cook for himself for the weekends right now in his apartment.

00:01:56.396 --> 00:01:59.818
Like, he's actually cooler. No, you're just like buying food?

00:01:59.818 --> 00:02:04.188
Oh, your bank, oh for you, ahm!

00:02:04.481 --> 00:02:05.289
um

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:09.706
but like buying all the groceries is so expensive around here

00:02:10.314 --> 00:02:11.931
mmmm

00:02:13.504 --> 00:02:16.018
Like it's mainly Trader Joe's or Ralphs.

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:22.464
That's true. I guess in that, they do just

00:02:26.318 --> 00:02:28.893
Yeah. Hope it's expensive.

00:02:29.893 --> 00:02:34.210
yeah, you should try for sure there

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:37.610
yeah

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.849
Are you going to keep watching that BTF?

00:02:44.527 --> 00:02:46.831
Mm. Yeah, that's true.

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:52.300
yeah

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.134
I don't know how it's gonna work. I've never like done groceries with my parents.

00:03:04.164 --> 00:03:08.324
Like I've never had to buy my own groceries, so I've never had like

00:03:08.247 --> 00:03:12.347
oh we're gonna do an allowance for groceries like there's no set rule for that

00:03:12.347 --> 00:03:14.743
Because I've never done it before.

00:03:17.967 --> 00:03:23.424
I feel like they'll just let me do what I think is good and if they notice I'm spending too much they'll just

00:03:23.308 --> 00:03:26.893
Think, ***Yeah.

00:03:36.546 --> 00:03:37.470
mm

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.296
I if want to get a lot of natto.

00:03:43.296 --> 00:03:46.222
I wanna eat bagels, a lot of eggs.

00:03:47.031 --> 00:03:49.658
I feel like I'm gonna make a lot of stir-frying

00:03:50.158 --> 00:03:52.611
 because I love stir fry. all

00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:55.176
All I need is stir fry and rice.

00:03:55.176 --> 00:04:00.171
And I'm happy too. It looks so good.

00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:09.994
So good, so good. And you could like you prepare food to you

00:04:12.962 --> 00:04:17.956
But like you can't meal prep too much because the freezer and the fridge have limited space.

00:04:17.956 --> 00:04:19.148
Hopefully home food

00:04:25.028 --> 00:04:26.929
Even if it's poor people? 

00:04:36.468 --> 00:04:37.752
Who?

00:04:38.088 --> 00:04:42.494
Wouldn't everyone have to cook? What would you do?

00:04:42.814 --> 00:04:45.648
Every day? For all three meals?

00:04:45.648 --> 00:04:48.417
 That's crazy. 

00:04:48.417 --> 00:04:51.114
And like the Westwood food isn't even cheap.

00:04:53.078 --> 00:04:58.574
 But DoorDash is expensive. So there's no point. That's the same thing as eating at Westwood. yeah

00:04:58.458 --> 00:05:01.983
I know. Tastes better?

00:05:04.026 --> 00:05:06.138
But like, who has money for that? 

00:05:07.756 --> 00:05:11.636
I don't. Huhuhahahah crazy.

00:05:15.152 --> 00:05:17.576
You shouldn't eat ramen every day though. 

00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:23.825
yes yes yes

00:05:27.684 --> 00:05:31.949
Yeah, I'm kind of worried. yeah

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:38.831
yeah

00:05:41.201 --> 00:05:45.826
No, like part of me wants to get off. I'm just worried about it. It's not like...

00:05:45.826 --> 00:05:49.622
I was set on not wanting to do it. I was just worried about it.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.499
Yeah..I know, I'm just like, I'm not used to having to go grocery shopping, you know?

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:03.494
I feel like cooking will like be the same amount of waiting in the freaking dining halls.

00:06:03.494 --> 00:06:04.388
It's like
