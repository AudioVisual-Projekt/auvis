00:01:16.897 --> 00:01:20.247
But feels like if I don't go anywhere it feels like I'm not validating

00:01:20.172 --> 00:01:21.920
Because like also I'm doing music

00:01:22.785 --> 00:01:24.891

I don't think so.

00:02:49.434 --> 00:02:50.009
Maybe.

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:55.172

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:48.125
But it it's closer to English.

00:05:49.693 --> 00:05:52.386
French is closer to English. That's easy to learn

00:05:56.322 --> 00:05:58.130
