Excuse me

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.396
Blaze is pretty good.

00:03:58.555 --> 00:04:00.309

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:10.063

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:19.717
Have you ever had? You have the pizza with me once. The pizza is so good.

00:04:19.717 --> 00:04:24.694
It is used. Oh so can like you're wasting it, yeah

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.836
Labs and stuff? mmhmm

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.723
Yeah, for sure.

00:04:36.857 --> 00:04:38.216
mmhmm mmhmm

00:04:40.641 --> 00:04:43.509

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.699
That was not good at all. Yeah.

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.792
It was like really spicy, which just wasn't good.

00:04:55.593 --> 00:05:00.588
But now they're closed. It's because they they're broke.

00:05:00.588 --> 00:05:05.396
Well. Do you think money. Not enough as like not as much as like out other

00:05:05.396 --> 00:05:09.598
Places they have I'm sure this is just a college campus, or

00:05:13.278 --> 00:05:16.703
They haven't said. And also they take forever to build.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.901
I don't think they're going to do a Chipotle. I think Chipotle is too big. I don't know.

00:05:22.278 --> 00:05:23.983
Chilli's are expensive

00:05:30.305 --> 00:05:33.201
Chili's just expensive in general. I don't think they would do Chipotle

00:05:33.163 --> 00:05:37.290
I don't think Chipotle really like Chipotle doesn't need to be on UCLA. You know what I mean?

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.285
Yeah, literally. And it's Chipotle, I don't think they're...

00:05:42.285 --> 00:05:46.100
mmm... How did you know?

00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:49.711
I never thought about I don't eat there anyway, so it doesn't matter to me

00:05:51.258 --> 00:05:52.732
How I ?

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.557
next year i'm not gonna bring food i don't have the money to pay for that

00:05:57.557 --> 00:06:00.088
It's so expensive on the campus.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.747
