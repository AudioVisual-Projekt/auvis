00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.865
I don't know if you chose the topic.. Yeah, you did. It was disgusting.

00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:34.101
right now.

00:00:37.313 --> 00:00:41.110
I've been providing more things than you have. Let's be real.

00:00:46.994 --> 00:00:48.157
It's so awesome.

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.802
so Oh

00:00:55.802 --> 00:00:58.653
What games do I play? Oh, I play...

00:00:58.598 --> 00:01:02.480
I don't play the same games as you. You play clash royale

00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:05.961
What's the difference between the two? They sound the same.

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.310
No, no, no.keep going  I'll listen.

00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:28.473
Death? Oh, like hearts? Oh.

00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:32.556
thats cool so ur gonna have both?

00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:47.277
So don't ask to smell. I smelled you in my bath yesterday.

00:01:47.304 --> 00:01:52.063
It wasn't that great, but it was okay.

00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:53.971
yeah

00:01:55.473 --> 00:01:58.593
I think that's great, that you have things you enjoy.

00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:12.634
I play spider in A push.

00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:15.976
Yeah

00:02:15.976 --> 00:02:20.718
i feel like spider's better though because solitaire, that's just like laying

00:02:20.718 --> 00:02:24.211
Spider you have like more options.

00:02:25.915 --> 00:02:28.885
Spider? The one I play is one sweep?

00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:33.744
so it's all spades, right? and then you know how in Salta you have to alternate colors?

00:02:33.744 --> 00:02:37.912
In spider you just keep going and then when you run out of things

00:02:37.885 --> 00:02:41.125
Like, run out of, like, cards to move, and click on the...

00:02:41.153 --> 00:02:44.326
I think that was called the other deck and it distributes one card to everyone

00:02:44.326 --> 00:02:49.135
And then all that's messed up, I have to remake K to Ace.

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:51.362
Yeah.

00:02:53.488 --> 00:02:55.209
Who said that?

00:03:00.154 --> 00:03:03.259
I used to be good at solids now. I was like...

00:03:03.231 --> 00:03:06.050
i use to be good at solitaire at 8th grade

00:03:10.178 --> 00:03:14.261
Yeah with actual cards

00:03:15.831 --> 00:03:20.083
I used to play with actual cards. It's like harder.

00:03:23.898 --> 00:03:28.201

00:03:31.896 --> 00:03:34.124

00:03:35.075 --> 00:03:39.158

00:03:42.543 --> 00:03:45.717

00:04:30.976 --> 00:04:34.334

00:05:27.158 --> 00:05:32.069

I've been so nice to you, though.

00:05:51.003 --> 00:05:54.361
All you know how to do is hate. Hate, hate, hate.

00:06:03.298 --> 00:06:05.171
At least you admit you're glazing him.

00:06:13.507 --> 00:06:17.238
Okay, now you're just glazing him. You're just glazing him.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.057
