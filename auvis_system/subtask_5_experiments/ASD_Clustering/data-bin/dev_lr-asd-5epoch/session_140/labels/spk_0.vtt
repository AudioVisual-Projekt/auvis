Genshin Impact is an open world RPG.

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:25.753
You know, Genshin actually isn't very open world.

00:00:25.753 --> 00:00:28.547
Like, compared to a lot of good, actually, open world

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:31.811
world games. It's not open world at all. There's so many loading screens to get into buildings.

00:00:31.811 --> 00:00:36.285
But an actual open world RPG? I don't know if you've played it.

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:39.843
The Final Fantasy... Final Fantasy XIV.

00:00:39.843 --> 00:00:44.793
I guess actually open world cuz like I walked into a building and I wasn't here with a loading screen and I was like wow

00:00:44.432 --> 00:00:49.327
i just walked into a building without a loading screen that's crazy

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.182
Oh- I- It's a free tutorial. the free,The free...

00:00:55.182 --> 00:00:58.507
The trail at the game ,it actually gets you to level 60

00:00:58.507 --> 00:01:03.747
And that's a lot of content. It's a lot of free content.

00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:11.495
Ohhhh..

00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:16.919
Yeah, play Final Fantasy XIV on Steam. Just get the demo, that's free.

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:21.643
It's like a lot of content for a demo, trust me. Hi.

00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:30.113
Will you play in Hong Kong?

00:01:40.104 --> 00:01:42.163
zero attention span with the sun.

00:02:00.117 --> 00:02:04.134
Every time I play Marvel Rivals, I put an ice pack on my comp.. my laptop.

00:02:04.134 --> 00:02:08.723
because that's the only way for it to run from smelling like soap. I'm not judging you.

00:02:08.723 --> 00:02:11.192
Like, I feel like

00:02:17.128 --> 00:02:19.288
I'm loading. Yeah

00:02:25.547 --> 00:02:30.255
30 minutes. 30 minutes is crazy.

00:02:52.058 --> 00:02:57.053
No, it's just a device problem. It's just that your device... No, it's just...

00:02:58.787 --> 00:03:01.073
Yea

00:03:18.283 --> 00:03:21.219
it fried your phone 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.731
It's just that the device is getting like worn out in the game

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.249
No, this tax is kind of lagging.

00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:53.956
Wait, you don't have Loose Text as an emulator? You don't know what an emulator is?

00:03:53.956 --> 00:03:59.913
I don't really like it, honestly. That's really like

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:33.264
Windows? You can get Genshin on a Windows computer.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.745
My gaming laptop is a window.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.045
I have a laptop .It works on mine

00:04:48.293 --> 00:04:52.478
Make sure you have a really good fan. Make sure you have a really good fan.

00:04:59.263 --> 00:05:00.240
Haahaahaa..

00:05:01.725 --> 00:05:06.097
so now it's low quality and really really, yeah

00:05:13.218 --> 00:05:14.247
I got ya.

00:05:17.876 --> 00:05:22.684
No, yeah, I got a gaming laptop back in like 2020 and that's why I can run all these games.

00:05:22.684 --> 00:05:26.634
The only reason I can run all these games is because I have a gaming laptop.

00:05:53.194 --> 00:05:58.193
Wait, it's so good to have like a good- I want a good setup one day.

00:06:02.071 --> 00:06:04.821
Like, you know what, have you played Sims? Like, the Sims 4?

00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:08.129
Like there's this joke that people who play the Sims 4, cause like it's a lot of

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:12.331
The joke is they bought a supercomputer that NASA could use.

00:06:12.331 --> 00:06:17.309
Just to run Sims 4. Because they have so many packs on you and stuff.
