WEBVTT

00:00:25.252 --> 00:00:25.808
Yes.

00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:40.895
We live in a patriarchal society.

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:49.905
patriarchy? what's a matriarchy?

00:00:49.905 --> 00:00:52.859
I wish we had that.

00:00:55.374 --> 00:00:57.871
I have actually.

00:00:57.871 --> 00:01:02.816
Take a guess. If misogynist, which is what you are.

00:01:02.816 --> 00:01:04.993
What am I?

00:01:06.056 --> 00:01:09.633
What's a chauvinist?

00:01:17.732 --> 00:01:20.231
What? I'm not a man.Hahaha

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.630
Yeah.

00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:45.812
What's that about?

00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:11.834
Is that a picture of me?

00:02:11.834 --> 00:02:13.487
I think Price would hate that one.

00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:32.490
Oh, he's a hater.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.050
I know what you're talking about. I like that person.

00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:43.660
What's your favourite (***) book(***). Yeah, that's what I'm saying

00:02:44.218 --> 00:02:48.217
What was it?

00:02:52.148 --> 00:02:54.308
Oh, where's the book?

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.965
Spy school. Spy school

00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:06.947
 Price mumbles.

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:13.748
I've never heard of that one.

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:26.962
Okay.

00:03:28.058 --> 00:03:31.433
What? nothing

00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:34.134
When do you give a mouse a cookie?

00:03:38.655 --> 00:03:43.635
I really like that one. Does that matter?

00:03:44.445 --> 00:03:46.941
You think,Do you always need

00:03:46.941 --> 00:03:51.819
So you can decide if you want to hate them or not? Is that the issue here?

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.290
What's your favorite book? Childhood book.

00:04:03.193 --> 00:04:07.410
Wait .I read them too.

00:04:14.076 --> 00:04:18.042
Oh my god, you're at a different level than me.

00:04:18.042 --> 00:04:20.776
I just read the books.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.333
I think I read most of them too.

00:04:32.285 --> 00:04:34.259
This guy's just a hater.

00:04:38.124 --> 00:04:40.588
Why's it so dark?

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.856
Yes.

00:05:00.465 --> 00:05:04.989
I like books. Books

00:05:06.103 --> 00:05:09.764
With the did you like dog books?

00:05:09.764 --> 00:05:13.814
Yeah, I didn't like them

00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:17.696
I couldn't get into them like I did for cats.

00:05:17.696 --> 00:05:20.210
Cats are better

00:05:26.876 --> 00:05:31.365
I didn't, I didn't, I, yeah, I didn't know that word. You're not alone. I didn't know that.

00:05:31.365 --> 00:05:33.321
Yeah.

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.410
You look like you did read

00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:46.350
That's a low bar

00:05:58.095 --> 00:06:00.795
I don't know what's 

00:06:15.782 --> 00:06:17.890
Haahaa
