WEBVTT

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.954
What?

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.382
Oh we were talking about how bad her class was.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.256
Really? You like her closet?

00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:40.554
Okay, she is interesting as a person.

00:00:40.554 --> 00:00:43.675
Did she ever bring out the Washington dolls?

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:47.759
She has dolls. She has a Washington and a Thomas Jefferson doll.

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:51.844
she brought it up when we were talking about the bonding fathers and she said yeah will you take off the

00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:56.146
her pants Washington has like dollar and like dollar pants

00:00:56.177 --> 00:00:59.805
and i think thomas jefferson has the american flag for underpants 

00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:06.137
She said that if I ever have children I'm going to make a play with it.

00:01:15.874 --> 00:01:18.792
It's like about...

00:01:18.792 --> 00:01:23.738
this and they are move them around..It's like a Barbie doll

00:01:23.738 --> 00:01:27.652
washington and thomas jefferson 

00:01:27.652 --> 00:01:32.023
they had also voice buttons  where they actually talk

00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:37.068
I don't remember what they said.

00:01:44.443 --> 00:01:48.038
Her birthday? I don't know. I don't keep track of the day and birthday. 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.289
Well if it did, she didn't do that.

00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:02.667
What Jeopardy and Kahoo!

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:07.173
 But you beat Jeopardy and Cuckoo!

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.865
No, she gives us a test. That's it

00:02:17.973 --> 00:02:20.505
No, she hasn't done that yet

00:02:20.505 --> 00:02:24.959
Honestly, all the people do is play games.

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.888
When she's talking because I think it's nobody pays attention to her lessons

00:02:29.888 --> 00:02:33.870
Like I know a friend who actually got like the barons like

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.650
book for a push and hahaha

00:02:38.882 --> 00:02:43.860
Yeah, and she's been taking notes on that instead.

00:02:45.597 --> 00:02:50.592
Basically, I don't pay attention to her lectures. I go to Heimlich's

00:02:50.592 --> 00:02:54.981
and I find notes online and I look at that.

00:03:04.126 --> 00:03:06.911
Yeah, the only thing useful about our class are the key terms.

00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:11.906
But the fact she's making it so you can use AI kind of like takes you there for a ride I think.

00:03:11.906 --> 00:03:11.957
you

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.120
I'm not reading that textbook. At the beginning of the year, I was like, OK, I'm going to read it.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.511
and then I read a few pages and it's so long. It's so big.

00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:33.118
and so long and they jump around different times. I don't like it.

00:03:33.793 --> 00:03:38.096
I saw a bunch of reviews on it because I searched it up and said this is like one of the worst books.

00:03:38.096 --> 00:03:40.037
Not worse but it's not that good.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.845
hahaha wait u guys...

00:03:52.845 --> 00:03:56.050
(****)

00:03:58.802 --> 00:04:02.700
I think maybe you're probably one out of like five people who said no.

00:04:11.661 --> 00:04:15.187
(****) like

00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:20.183
We have like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 people at most.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.514
It's not bad, but that's it.

00:04:25.514 --> 00:04:29.935
Because they're either like kind of like annoying when they're talking

00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:32.822
Or they go on for like really long. 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.820
Only one of them because one of them was my friend yeah

00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:50.726
No one was answering her questions actually. Only like two people I think.

00:04:50.726 --> 00:04:53.966
My friends are starting to answer her questions because they like the talk.

00:04:53.966 --> 00:04:57.661
They like this specific area of history.

00:04:58.877 --> 00:05:01.375
It was like after the Spanish-American War.

00:05:01.375 --> 00:05:04.969
Yeah, they really like the watermelon part

00:05:10.908 --> 00:05:13.034
MC's? 

00:05:14.031 --> 00:05:16.528
If you study they're not hard at all.

00:05:16.528 --> 00:05:20.899
I think they're kind of easy. And you can also get away with barely

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:25.589
for the FRQs as well. FRQs, LDQs, SAQs.

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:28.120
They're all easy to get away with.like..

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.425
just like barely studying because you can just kind of like write whatever.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.865
7 points but then  it's ummm5 points per 7.

00:05:51.865 --> 00:05:51.983
you.

00:05:56.387 --> 00:06:00.723
. Damn, really?

00:06:00.723 --> 00:06:03.070
15 to 20

00:06:07.858 --> 00:06:10.558
For the first one, I got like a 20.

00:06:10.528 --> 00:06:13.312
We're at like a 20-25.

00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:17.548
But the thing is, she led us all, like, she, for the next, for a few, she said,

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:22.571
This one would have saved the last FRQ and everybody got like a 32 or a 35.

00:06:25.901 --> 00:06:30.525
Probably, but the thing is I don't think she's a better teacher

00:06:30.524 --> 00:06:33.411
It's just easier to pass now

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.684
The AP or APUSH, the actual AP test.

00:06:40.683 --> 00:06:45.678
Oh, definitely. Everybody knows. Everybody talks about it. For the AP test? Yeah, we're all screwed.

00:06:45.678 --> 00:06:49.863
We haven't actually practiced writing a good essay.

00:06:49.863 --> 00:06:54.858
Because I think everybody by now has realized you can just write anything as long as it's

00:06:54.858 --> 00:06:59.161
Accurate yeah

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:05.591
But no, the first three to four efforts you had, it was all him.

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:08.528
So we already went through that.
