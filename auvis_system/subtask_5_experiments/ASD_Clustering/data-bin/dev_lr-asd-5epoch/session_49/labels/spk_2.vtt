WEBVTT

00:00:35.954 --> 00:00:39.246
Okay, we were talking about...

00:00:41.593 --> 00:00:43.618
Oh, yeah. yeah

00:00:46.114 --> 00:00:47.962
ahh

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:53.134
huhmmmm

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:07.917
Yeah I thought it was good too.

00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:11.748
I guess yeah, it's kind of funky

00:01:11.748 --> 00:01:14.447
(***) sometimes (***)

00:01:14.447 --> 00:01:17.435
I feel like they just don't say it directly sometimes.

00:01:17.435 --> 00:01:21.265
Like the things that I want to hear directly, they don't really sound good.

00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:25.248
oh like (***)

00:01:25.248 --> 00:01:30.007
They don't really say exactly what you're lacking. They do say what you're lacking.

00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:34.326
But then it's like when they say no to a piece.

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:37.871
They don't really say why.

00:01:37.871 --> 00:01:42.848
like (***) Last year I didn't get to play any concerto

00:01:42.848 --> 00:01:47.759
showpiece, any like double stoppie, like a little flashy, like

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.146
None of that, it was all like lyrical, slow movements kind of stuff.

00:01:52.146 --> 00:01:55.909
So I don't know.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.786
Yeah, I said like even if I brought it up they would suggest oh, yeah family

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:03.975
last year, and then

00:02:03.975 --> 00:02:08.969
i think, the end of spring quarter they like ask me what I want.

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:12.717
But yeah, for the most part last year I didn't have a sting.

00:02:12.717 --> 00:02:15.231
And I

00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:20.193
She knows, but like, I didn't really enjoy some of them. Or like, I didn't really like some of them, but...

00:02:20.193 --> 00:02:24.933
I didn't really have a choice, so I just had to do it.

00:02:24.933 --> 00:02:25.610
Yeah.

00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:30.030
like don't  want to do corn balls.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.789
i didn't,  I don't know. I don't know if I'll ask.

00:02:37.336 --> 00:02:42.061
Maybe I'll ask him. I think it's a little too early. 

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.067
Maybe if I start... Maybe if I start...

00:02:45.067 --> 00:02:49.824
get to the third movement of the prokofiev maybe i'll like maybe pitch in the idea

00:02:49.824 --> 00:02:52.340
Yeah, cuz like last year

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.342
I brought, I think I brought trike.

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:58.769
first movement and then like bop to her

00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:05.367
And then it was like the first lesson with her and then she was like

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:08.538
Yeah, let's do something else that's not the chain.

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:13.044
Yeah. (***) she gave me something else to work on

00:03:13.044 --> 00:03:16.317
I think it's like the Chaik meditation.

00:03:16.317 --> 00:03:21.010
yeah  yeah and i did that for like 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.567
a good chunk (***)

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.644
(***) like no (***) I feel like for me it doesn't

00:03:38.644 --> 00:03:41.429
Take too long?

00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:00.294
Wait, what did you bring to her? The corn mold?

00:04:02.753 --> 00:04:03.360
yeah

00:04:05.093 --> 00:04:06.621
hummmm

00:04:09.972 --> 00:04:11.847
oh

00:04:28.122 --> 00:04:32.881
mmmm I feel like yeah

00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:35.750
last year it was like

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.562
 barely a piece a quarter like

00:04:44.305 --> 00:04:48.221
Yeah, I think I worked on the Tchaikovsky meditation for like a whole quarter.

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:51.004
and then

00:04:51.004 --> 00:04:54.632
We also had the Vivaldi and the Vivaldi was like

00:04:54.632 --> 00:04:57.384
We had to do it in five weeks.

00:04:57.384 --> 00:05:01.771
After that, I started the Prokofiev Five Melodies.

00:05:01.771 --> 00:05:04.605
and I had it until the end of spring semester.

00:05:04.605 --> 00:05:08.538
last year i think i only did (***) 

00:05:27.403 --> 00:05:31.302
I feel like that's just how... It's hard to tell.

00:05:31.302 --> 00:05:35.149
Especially we still have to do the LSD

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:39.639
Colossian is much more difficult to read. In my opinion.

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:45.646
 He like tries to like go around

00:05:48.548 --> 00:05:53.543
yeah fun ike, what am I lacking? i think

00:05:55.771 --> 00:06:00.512
i think like Did you do the Beethoven with him? (***)

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.533
Yeah, i feel like (***)

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:18.603
Maybe that's 

00:06:19.817 --> 00:06:21.173
yeah

00:06:23.463 --> 00:06:28.456
yeah I remember, like, with the Prokofiev, he was always like, okay.

00:06:28.456 --> 00:06:33.098
I'll see this next week again and it was just like that for like

00:06:33.098 --> 00:06:37.502
a quarter and a half
