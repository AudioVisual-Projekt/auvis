00:00:36.952 --> 00:00:38.383
huhuuu

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.117
So like she wanted me to like work on my technique first.

00:00:46.117 --> 00:00:51.112
So she was like, if you can get the technique done, then you're going to sound so much better. So don't 

00:00:51.138 --> 00:00:54.327
and do it next year. 

00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:58.588
I wanna at least try. And then like, yeah, that's what happened.

00:00:58.588 --> 00:01:00.006
She didn't want me to do it.

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.305
yeah thank you

00:01:06.192 --> 00:01:08.684

00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:38.075

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.364
Did they like suggest all the pieces to you?

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:03.368

00:02:29.353 --> 00:02:31.024
she said no

00:02:31.096 --> 00:02:33.021
Oh, you haven't asked?

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.283

00:03:24.067 --> 00:03:28.303
Wait, so like how fast do you go through pieces?

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:31.915
Like how long does it take you guys to like

00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:34.159
we (***) one piece

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.128
I meant like, with the teacher. Like, when are you done having lessons?

00:03:45.128 --> 00:03:50.123
on that piece because it's taking me a long time

00:03:50.358 --> 00:03:53.311
Like, to get through all these pieces right now.

00:03:54.021 --> 00:03:58.138
And I just don't know if they expect me to do more or like...

00:04:00.653 --> 00:04:05.462
So we switch teachers, right? So I do Korngold with Bardi.

00:04:05.462 --> 00:04:09.984
But then, since I've been taking lessons with Pagosian, I've been doing Beethoven IV.

00:04:09.984 --> 00:04:14.963
I don't know, I just feel like we're never getting through the first movement.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:18.303
well today I finished it but like

00:04:18.878 --> 00:04:22.286
