WEBVTT

00:00:37.493 --> 00:00:40.934
So we're talking about, like, 14D.

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:43.078
(***)

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.183
I am Okay, I know someone who took her.

00:00:46.183 --> 00:00:51.178
And she said that she feels like her teaching style just isn't effective for her.

00:00:51.178 --> 00:00:54.587
But Sarah.

00:00:56.025 --> 00:00:57.030
oh

00:00:57.776 --> 00:00:59.936
Oh, she's taking it right now. Oh, right, right, right.

00:00:59.907 --> 00:01:04.278
Yeah, and then I didn't have her, but in my lab in spring quarter.

00:01:04.576 --> 00:01:07.850
My professor was hospitalized during time.

00:01:04.603 --> 00:01:07.775
my professor was hospitalization that time

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.714
Oh, she adds a substitute chord to the rest of the chord.

00:01:11.714 --> 00:01:14.229
So she gave us one lecture and I got nothing.

00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:16.855
yeah

00:01:17.402 --> 00:01:21.805
like the way she ,she was very i like i walked out of that lecture

00:01:21.805 --> 00:01:25.265
and I just thought, was she so overstimulating to listen to?

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:29.079
she very fast, she kind of 

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:30.867
ahh

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:35.643
I don't know. She's very, like, fidgety. And so when you're watching someone...

00:01:35.643 --> 00:01:39.711
Talk like that, like, yeah. And she kinda like...

00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:44.571
its not (***) too much (***)

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:47.726
but she'll like make like double stompies and then just keep going

00:01:47.726 --> 00:01:52.619
yeah its like, It's a little hard to focus.

00:01:58.036 --> 00:02:00.788
yeah fam

00:02:00.788 --> 00:02:03.487
Fam like I've heard universally is like pretty good.

00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:08.601
Ahhh. I know dr. O sometimes teaches it again

00:02:09.242 --> 00:02:11.107
Yeah.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.496
Mm mm

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:41.980
(***) huuu i

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.619
no no i (***) time

00:02:48.492 --> 00:02:52.255
Yeah, yeah

00:02:52.492 --> 00:02:55.327
I heard that he was like, drunk yeah

00:03:05.723 --> 00:03:08.928
Oh, they do (***)

00:03:08.928 --> 00:03:13.688
No, like you're selling a phone 

00:03:13.688 --> 00:03:16.135
Yeah

00:03:16.438 --> 00:03:20.151
yeah  they require yeah and i just have

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:30.242
Yeah, I mean some they make you go anyways

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:32.249
Like location.

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.962
I know! yeah

00:03:38.492 --> 00:03:40.650
yeah

00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:50.373
Yeah, I don't know why. yeah

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:52.652
That's crazy.

00:03:54.103 --> 00:03:56.651
I was gonna say

00:03:56.651 --> 00:04:00.026
Anjali's memorization thing. Yeah.

00:04:00.785 --> 00:04:04.160
On the first day of class, Dr. Oh said to us, he was like,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.029
A lot of people say OCamp is memorization.

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.843
but I don't think it's memorization, it's pattern recognition.

00:04:10.843 --> 00:04:14.605
And I think that makes more sense because I don't memorize reactions, you know?

00:04:14.605 --> 00:04:18.166
I look at it and I'm like, oh, this could happen, this could happen.

00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:19.736
You know?

00:04:23.365 --> 00:04:26.469
I mean, yeah, but it's not so much like...

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.261
flashcards like memorized

00:04:31.261 --> 00:04:35.616
 yeah it's not like  you just know like oh 

00:04:35.952 --> 00:04:39.159
It's not like memorizing charts. Yeah.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.741
yeah like this attacks this (***) rectangle (***)

00:04:45.741 --> 00:04:50.348
(***) The aero pushing.

00:04:50.348 --> 00:04:54.516
i mean that aero pushing (***)

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:03.079
Yeah

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:08.605
Yeah.

00:05:19.288 --> 00:05:20.655
Oh, yeah

00:05:20.908 --> 00:05:24.721
Yeah, I'm very bad at remembering reactants.

00:05:24.721 --> 00:05:26.528
hu hukmmmm

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.744
