WEBVTT

00:00:37.052 --> 00:00:38.030
okay

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:42.132
yes

00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:53.317
mmm 

00:01:07.502 --> 00:01:09.008
ohh

00:01:15.544 --> 00:01:17.418
Lately, what's bad about it?

00:01:25.662 --> 00:01:27.341
ohhh

00:01:38.316 --> 00:01:40.463
Mmm

00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:54.409
MMmm

00:01:56.044 --> 00:02:01.040
Yeah, we just said Finn was good.  Oh, okay, okay.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.190
you

00:02:03.993 --> 00:02:06.050
Finn yeah

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.835
And I'm really good I

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:20.293
explaining the concept, which is obviously the main part.

00:02:20.293 --> 00:02:23.230
But she doesn't do many examples in class.

00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:28.275
The exams are similar to the homework, but he doesn't.

00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:32.359
Yeah, so the hallmark's where you get the exact spotlight.

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.936
Applying it you have to kind of learn on your own.

00:02:35.936 --> 00:02:38.991
 Ruben

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:42.011
But I don't think he teaches regularly.

00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:46.230
You don't have to worry about him.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.876
okay mam yeah

00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:00.641
oh Wait my friend

00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:05.467
at UC San Diego told me that they use iCooker remotes.

00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:08.894
yeah physical remotes and they cost like 40 yeah

00:03:08.894 --> 00:03:13.719
No, no, no like yourself has to buy this $50. I click a remote

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.267
this big

00:03:16.267 --> 00:03:20.436
yeah it's not an app its (***) yeah

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.186
I guess, but I also think they just have an old system. at that point

00:03:30.325 --> 00:03:33.700
its (***) location

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.745
Exactly, and they have to pay, it's like 50 bucks. i know

00:03:38.694 --> 00:03:39.082
KATHRYN Taking a look at your forecast tonight...

00:03:44.094 --> 00:03:45.039
Yeah.

00:03:49.967 --> 00:03:53.984
I don't know  Yes.

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:55.063
yes

00:04:11.264 --> 00:04:12.074
oka

00:04:19.313 --> 00:04:22.722
But unless you memorize the reactions, you don't know what could happen.

00:04:22.722 --> 00:04:25.169
you know i mean

00:04:38.068 --> 00:04:41.030
mmm

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:53.693
mm

00:04:57.619 --> 00:05:00.590
I think it's both.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.758
Yeah, its like

00:05:04.758 --> 00:05:08.318
Part of the exam for us was like arrow pushing, right?

00:05:08.318 --> 00:05:12.030
yeah so that's conceptual like knowing how it moves but like

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.017
for like the ones where you like fill in what the react

00:05:15.017 --> 00:05:18.275
or the product is, that's mainly memorization.

00:05:18.275 --> 00:05:21.616
knowing like what happens before and after.

00:05:24.382 --> 00:05:25.863
mm

00:05:27.707 --> 00:05:31.267
(***) I think she's comp bio. 

00:05:31.267 --> 00:05:36.195
(***) Yeah, yeah, but she still has to do the LS core stuff

00:05:36.195 --> 00:05:39.621
so and she is (***)

00:05:42.068 --> 00:05:44.126
I think she likes math more.

00:05:47.754 --> 00:05:49.309
(***)

00:05:50.505 --> 00:05:55.366
(***) has pretty cool like concentrations you can do early

00:05:55.366 --> 00:06:00.191
yeah there's a bioinformatics (*** ) and like

00:06:00.191 --> 00:06:01.998
I forgot the other ones, but...

00:06:04.005 --> 00:06:07.313
Like, all, I feel like the rest of them were like, sci majors.

00:06:07.313 --> 00:06:12.190
You don't really get a concentration. It's kind of broad. Do they?

00:06:16.003 --> 00:06:20.188
Oh, for real? Okay. It's just my major. Okay.

00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:21.859
yeah huhuu

00:06:23.041 --> 00:06:26.347
does biochem have concentration? 

00:06:30.728 --> 00:06:32.456
Mmm
