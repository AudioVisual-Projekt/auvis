I feel like if I were to start a new piece, 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:49.484
I would bring it up to Foreign, I don't think I would bring up to foreign

00:01:50.387 --> 00:01:55.383
Unless unless, he mentions it, I don't think I would ever bring it up.

00:01:56.365 --> 00:01:58.976
I am little scared. Huhuh

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.704

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.665

I wonder if it's by pick.

00:02:26.027 --> 00:02:28.170
I feel like they look at something.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:34.211
Cuz I don't know. I don't know

00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:38.126
Like it's very hard to tell. like maybe it is 5.1.

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:43.205
I feel like, yeah, a little bit, but like it can't be all.

00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:48.200
May be yeah, but ago

00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:51.948

Wait, but Kayla and Emily-

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.982
Does Emily take license?

00:03:16.888 --> 00:03:19.386

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.554
Character

00:03:53.322 --> 00:03:56.471
Sometimes Pugosiana is better at explaining things.

00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:02.838
I feel like for you since Jiyoung is like very direct with explaining things

00:04:02.721 --> 00:04:07.446
counselling twice is sometime, confusing. But like for me...

00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:11.210
Jiyoung is very- or not Jiyoung, Barney is very like

00:04:12.152 --> 00:04:15.056
Yeah, he's canna like, not feel not like 

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:20.752
Feels so, it's that's kind of like her vibe, so sometimes like Pogostin's lesson is a little more complicated.

00:04:21.184 --> 00:04:24.067
Yeah, for me mm..

00:04:24.995 --> 00:04:26.060

Or like, rest I mostly like

00:05:45.928 --> 00:05:51.277
