00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:27.186
Oh, KKC? Oh, we're talking about KKC now? Okay.

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:30.349
Oh wait, I had something to say but then I forgot.

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:35.860
um okay wait

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:39.326
It'll come to me.

00:00:41.177 --> 00:00:43.573

00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:50.072

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.529
I show up I know i will see i wil see

00:00:57.529 --> 00:01:01.342
I haven't, I've only drafted so far.

00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:05.392
DOC but I don't have a sense on DOC at all.

00:01:07.727 --> 00:01:11.861
They might tie it up for a chance.

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:16.390
Oh, whoopsies. umm

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:21.328
no Why would I do robotics to identify all you idiots?

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:27.667
That's not gonna happen. Is it?

00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:31.345
I feel like it's only going to be a single president next year

00:01:34.232 --> 00:01:36.138
You could.

00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:41.264
Oh yeah.

00:01:43.277 --> 00:01:47.545
yeah thats true I feel like the thing with robotics is that they literally like

00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:50.179
They're so bad at nurturing. What is this?

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:53.509
Like they have their priorities completely offset.

00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:57.148
yeah

00:02:00.134 --> 00:02:03.610
It wasn't always like that, huh? It wasn't always like that though

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.315
Like last year.

00:02:07.256 --> 00:02:10.479
Oh yeah.

00:02:24.974 --> 00:02:27.134
yeah That's true thats true

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:37.947
um How about that new program starting up, the ED?

00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:39.555
for real?

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.356
Oh, okay. That's fair, that's fair.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.728
i see i see i see

00:03:01.674 --> 00:03:05.234
Wait, so have I started? Because sign-ups are open, isn't it?

00:03:24.274 --> 00:03:28.644
yeah the thing is like (**) or like the the previous 

00:03:28.644 --> 00:03:31.395
like imagery stuff

00:03:31.394 --> 00:03:35.883
or whatever the program name is called. yeah.

00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:39.799
Like, they always say, oh, we're gonna do this, we're gonna do that, but then, like, nothing happened

00:03:39.771 --> 00:03:42.352
Especially like postseason

00:03:50.986 --> 00:03:51.914
Yeah.

00:04:09.785 --> 00:04:14.729
So our other topic is KKCU.

00:04:14.702 --> 00:04:15.394
Um...

00:04:26.997 --> 00:04:31.401
What's for next year, dude? It's too late.  No.

00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:33.737

00:04:41.308 --> 00:04:45.290
If there is and I'll do it so it's like if not, oh well,like

00:04:45.262 --> 00:04:49.076
You know, YOLO or whatever. Oh, YOLO as in you only live once.

00:04:49.076 --> 00:04:53.818
 just for clarification huh?

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.406

Kai's really good. Bro, you should step up.

00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:29.569
You should step up.

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:35.831
Oh yeah, is senioritis hitting hard?

00:05:53.107 --> 00:05:55.047
