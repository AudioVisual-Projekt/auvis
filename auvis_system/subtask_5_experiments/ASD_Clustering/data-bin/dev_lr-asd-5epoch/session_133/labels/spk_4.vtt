WEBVTT

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.505
So...

00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:28.053
um Can I pick up where I left off?

00:00:28.053 --> 00:00:31.260
Okay, so for WandaVision her costume

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.086
looked really really natural because they stressed the fabric enough so it didn't look like

00:00:36.086 --> 00:00:40.760
it completely new, but it just looked used and that made sense to me.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.612
It was like, It was like

00:00:43.612 --> 00:00:48.319
her superhero costumes. It was like, really like...

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:53.314
i didnt feel like  it was like a plastic you fabric like a fake fabric that was nice. 

00:00:53.315 --> 00:00:53.568
yeah

00:00:59.727 --> 00:01:02.781
It's a little too shiny. 

00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:06.544
Yes like...

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.190
I feel like they should be like...

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.864
Like prop makers should be able to like make chess plates and stuff because I feel like they would make it

00:01:14.864 --> 00:01:18.425
realistic right. yeahh

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.487
Let's talk about let's talk about the movie right 

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:30.001
Okay, so like...ummm

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.751
My favorite avengers  movie is

00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:35.738
I think Age of Ultron

00:01:35.738 --> 00:01:38.944
I just really like

00:01:38.944 --> 00:01:42.101
how they aren't at each other's throats.

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:45.272
And they're working as a team.

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:50.218
yeahh Have you watched it?

00:01:50.218 --> 00:01:52.732
 i Don't

00:01:52.704 --> 00:01:57.429
I'm okay with the Lego movie.

00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:02.435
Like, I just, I don't know. I haven't watched it in a while. I need a refresher, but I'll probably like it.

00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:04.729
i Like Lego Batman

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:08.544
I love Lego Batman.

00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:26.600
I was like watching Michael Batman the other day and I was like, wow.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.123
This actually is really funny.

00:02:32.057 --> 00:02:36.461
It's a comedy for real. Are there any other movies, like Ghibli movies?

00:02:36.488 --> 00:02:41.450
Are there any Ghibli movies you're into? Ghibli. Studio Ghibli.

00:02:49.684 --> 00:02:52.874
Okay, um, I also like it. It's good.

00:02:56.475 --> 00:02:59.208
Are you looking at him with the black hair?

00:03:03.775 --> 00:03:06.542
That's a hot take. That's a hot take.

00:03:08.297 --> 00:03:12.551
That's huge. It looks like he's gonna like steal your whole life.

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:24.160
I mean, like, he's naturally long. Yeah, he's European.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.713
They are all european

00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:32.126
It's cute. I like it. I heard like the original book was kind of scary tho

00:03:36.203 --> 00:03:41.198
It's like, it's like Disney princesses versus the Grimm's Brothers.

00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:44.309
Like, for how is it a castle, I think, um...

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:48.207
I really like Sophie, she was very, she was like

00:03:48.207 --> 00:03:52.612
she feels really silly like i think she adjusted a little too quickly

00:03:54.407 --> 00:03:56.988
She just accepted it. Yeah.

00:03:57.016 --> 00:04:01.167
Like she doesn't have an existential crisis at some point?

00:04:06.855 --> 00:04:09.808
Like, she doesn't feel like the main character in that movie.

00:04:09.808 --> 00:04:14.802
We don't really get to see what she's thinking, we just see what's happening.

00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:21.440
Howl's Moving Castle. She's just a storyteller.

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:26.683
Also, I feel like it's so off-putting that...

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:30.480
He was like 30 and she was just like 18.

00:04:36.487 --> 00:04:40.605
yeahh (****)

00:04:40.605 --> 00:04:45.600
Like, you know Snow White, like 16 and like 32.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.586
like he's literally twice her age

00:04:50.307 --> 00:04:51.826
no actually

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.532
It's still kind of different.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.530
And that's.

00:05:25.862 --> 00:05:30.335
They were on something. They were on something.

00:05:30.335 --> 00:05:34.232
Do you have a favorite Disney princess movie?

00:05:37.422 --> 00:05:42.417
Sleeping Beauty, oh that was so cute. I love the Maleficent live action.

00:05:42.417 --> 00:05:47.126
oh they were so pretty oh my god i love the cgi in that one

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.490
It's getting worse

00:05:56.491 --> 00:06:00.558
Like the first and second were both really good.

00:06:03.646 --> 00:06:06.600
I haven't watched that one. i havent watched

00:06:08.405 --> 00:06:13.400
Oh, Cruella? Oh, you were totally talking about that Dalmatian one. like

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.948
(****)

00:06:15.948 --> 00:06:20.942
What was CGI in that one? Other than the obvious... like..

00:06:20.942 --> 00:06:21.855
That's a lot.
