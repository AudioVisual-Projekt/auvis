WEBVTT

00:00:35.183 --> 00:00:36.888
So 

00:00:37.157 --> 00:00:41.039
i have not do you think it's a little bit weird if I

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.628
just some random girl you met roughly a year ago who thought

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:50.624
You were cute. Messaged you still and keeps trying.

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:59.685
Honestly, me too

00:00:59.713 --> 00:01:04.202
but especially if he has

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:05.221
Like...

00:01:05.423 --> 00:01:10.283
No other like girls or especially if he doesn't have a roster

00:01:10.283 --> 00:01:14.621
You know and he only he is like less than 150 followers

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:16.746
Yeah.

00:01:17.255 --> 00:01:21.440
Bro he has a sunset profile picture, I don't think.

00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:23.767
umm

00:01:24.154 --> 00:01:26.719
What if he's like

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.191
Oh, I don't really like her though, but then she doesn't want to block

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:35.629
me so that's why he's like dry

00:01:37.587 --> 00:01:40.051
But what if it's because he doesn't want to be rude?

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.066
Wait, me too. Me too. Wait, I...

00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:54.581
If I was him and if I didn't like myself...

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:59.490
I would have blocked myself at this point, not gonna lie, because it's not like I'm gonna sleep.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.781
No, but that's such a bad mindset though, it's like

00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:18.222
Do you think it's weird that I keep making the first move?

00:02:18.222 --> 00:02:20.906
Really?

00:02:20.906 --> 00:02:25.123
Because there's no mutual moves, you know

00:02:25.528 --> 00:02:26.795
Scared.

00:02:28.094 --> 00:02:31.722
Would you be even more scared?

00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:52.883
W-O-R-O, yeah

00:02:56.006 --> 00:03:00.679
Okay, let's let's draft a message then so

00:03:02.654 --> 00:03:07.530
I wish lamp could just drop right now. So I'm like, oh jeez

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.518
new live album they dropped in 2024

00:03:10.518 --> 00:03:13.927
But that was the first time they dropped in like over a decade I think.

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:16.694
Yeah, I don't think they're gonna drop anytime soon.

00:03:22.806 --> 00:03:26.856
No, but then don't you think

00:03:26.802 --> 00:03:29.620
i would sound like one of those guys that are like wow

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.821
If you like Bruno Mars, name me two songs right now.

00:03:35.644 --> 00:03:40.639
You know what I mean? Have you ever met someone like that? I have. Oh, I mean, no I haven't.

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:40.809
Thank you.

00:04:03.471 --> 00:04:08.466
yeah, No, what if what if lock in with me right what is

00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:13.376
He's posting it because he was like, oh this girl likes

00:04:13.376 --> 00:04:16.684
This artist may be some other girl.

00:04:16.684 --> 00:04:21.595
who he's plotting on will also like this artist.hmmm

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:35.315
I don't think you're losing.

00:04:35.315 --> 00:04:38.724
Maybe you're a loser at heart, I think.

00:04:42.638 --> 00:04:46.688
Thank you. I know you're lying.

00:04:46.688 --> 00:04:49.844
Really?

00:04:54.637 --> 00:04:59.396
I know you mean I think amongst  everyone at this table

00:04:59.396 --> 00:05:02.771
Kumaar looks the most loser coded.

00:05:02.771 --> 00:05:07.209
He looks like he's destined to be in Shabol. hahaha

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:09.740
Yeah

00:05:12.793 --> 00:05:16.168
Right? No, like sharing a bowl.

00:05:16.168 --> 00:05:19.865
That was like a whole loser outfit.

00:05:19.865 --> 00:05:21.873
Soul loser energy.

00:05:25.113 --> 00:05:28.318
but but during the glow up photo

00:05:28.318 --> 00:05:33.313
Um, you know, that was very not loser-toted, you know what I mean?

00:05:33.313 --> 00:05:33.348
you

00:05:49.193 --> 00:05:52.721
uh huh yeah totally not tricking at all

00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:56.668
I completely agree. And...

00:05:56.668 --> 00:06:00.702
I 100% agree with you. causee

00:06:07.571 --> 00:06:12.532
We're definitely soulmates in another universe.

00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:15.113
This would do.hmmhm

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:19.564
I just need to keep applying pressure, huh? Yeah.

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:27.483
uh huh
