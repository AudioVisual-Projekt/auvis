00:00:37.295 --> 00:00:42.257
Do you have any conspiracy theories about it yet? Like Catherine from?

00:00:42.257 --> 00:00:45.513
Adventures ago, how do you see these?

00:00:50.626 --> 00:00:54.559
There's so many of them.

00:01:00.353 --> 00:01:05.348
If you like stand by her and the AFK, like the voice line from the MPC's like little chat bubble.

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:10.371
Yeah, and then also the keyhole in the back of her 

00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:10.506
Thank you.

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.694
Do you have any idea like, uhhh

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.478
is about like this

00:01:33.454 --> 00:01:36.892
ohhh

00:01:46.635 --> 00:01:50.617
I like the theories, they're pretty fun. I mean Fontaine had like a ton of theories

00:01:50.617 --> 00:01:53.756
There's a bunch of there's like

00:01:53.756 --> 00:01:58.734
6 to 8 word class that were actually linked together in a social network to give like a real piece of work.

00:02:01.546 --> 00:02:06.541
but right now with natalyn wait can i give you spoilers ?

00:02:06.514 --> 00:02:10.463
 what?

00:02:12.234 --> 00:02:16.486
So basically you're doing that and that leg.

00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:21.481
There's like this entire tournament going on and then people are competing to go fight the abyss.

00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:24.114
and like a war and then like

00:02:24.114 --> 00:02:28.468
One of the characters that you meet when you die is a little 8 year old child.

00:02:28.468 --> 00:02:31.759
What's going on? and She dies?

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:36.162
And then they're supposed to bring her back. That's like customary, right?

00:02:36.162 --> 00:02:40.500
But she doesn't come back, so they're like, what's going on? so then

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.495
Honestly, that's as far as I've gotten so far, but I know at the end, one of the harbingers

00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:49.191
Like the guy with the weird mask and like, yeah

00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:52.717
So basically, he shows up to that one.

00:02:52.717 --> 00:02:57.578
It's canon, the Harbingers are capable of taking off their fur coats.

00:02:57.578 --> 00:03:02.573
They're capable of taking the Colt Top? Crazy, right? Okay, um, so they- sorry.

00:03:02.573 --> 00:03:05.155
 so 

00:03:05.155 --> 00:03:09.676
 because and then they fight with the (***)

00:03:09.677 --> 00:03:13.170
At the end, I heard he dies. I don't know why.

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.819
I haven't done the quest itself yet.

00:03:15.847 --> 00:03:20.842
umm yeah we are getting about to it 

00:03:20.814 --> 00:03:24.949
Me, I speak to myself.

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:29.909

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.787

00:03:34.787 --> 00:03:38.483
