00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:15.815
One will begin.

00:00:17.738 --> 00:00:21.991
Hey Ariana, what's your favorite game?

00:00:25.873 --> 00:00:30.799
There's no show you exclusively play Call of(***).

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:33.382
There's no shot, right?

00:00:35.626 --> 00:00:36.723
Right.

00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:39.230
Right.

00:00:40.755 --> 00:00:44.316
Wait ha ha.

00:00:48.957 --> 00:00:53.514
Can you do Ethernet? No, Ethernet.

00:01:02.036 --> 00:01:03.469
Why?

00:01:08.228 --> 00:01:10.810
(***)Where are they going to do that?

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:20.514
You should just get a PC.

00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:23.466
Yea.

00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:26.538
And they don't even use a Playstation.

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:31.044
But why?

00:01:34.452 --> 00:01:36.005
You have a laptop yeah?

00:01:38.316 --> 00:01:41.574
Because Fortnite is bad.

00:01:41.574 --> 00:01:43.547
Ballerina.

00:01:44.274 --> 00:01:48.812
Minecraft can also be hard to run sometimes. Have you tried League of Legends?

00:01:48.812 --> 00:01:50.383
Ha ha ha

00:01:52.627 --> 00:01:57.386
Hey, it's from 2007. It's not that intense. 

00:01:57.386 --> 00:02:01.351
Either way, it's not that intensive. It feeds into Windows 10 basically.

00:02:03.848 --> 00:02:05.216
So this is my side.

00:02:10.277 --> 00:02:15.240
No, maybe just better off with Java or Windows better off.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.315
There's bedrock on windows.

00:02:24.757 --> 00:02:29.751
It's single player. It's single player.

00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:34.037
Okay, is it super flat or is it like an actual wall and it's like.

00:02:34.257 --> 00:02:35.674
Uhh unlimited.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.044
What's your- what's your render? You rendered this in 10 and you still can't run it?

00:02:44.567 --> 00:02:48.246
What about your graphics? What are your graphics settings?

00:02:49.624 --> 00:02:51.875
Okay, so...

00:02:54.356 --> 00:02:59.351
Okay, at least you have a PS4 and you don't condemn yourself to League of Legends. So you're fine.

00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:02.252
Legal is just a really bad way.

00:03:04.245 --> 00:03:06.084
Fair enough.

00:03:12.345 --> 00:03:17.340
Oh, I heard it's really good

00:03:20.984 --> 00:03:24.208
Wait, and Call of Duty is still your favorite game?

00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:31.294
I asked you what your favorite game is and you said, uh, Modern Warfare?

00:03:32.173 --> 00:03:34.450
Over spider-man

00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:41.318
So you're more into the modern warfare lore and campaign.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.532
Ha ha ha.

00:04:14.996 --> 00:04:17.397
Ha hah ha.

00:04:19.338 --> 00:04:22.713
See that's why you don't play COD

00:04:22.713 --> 00:04:25.294
Oh, where do zombies go in the lore?

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:28.011
Ha ha ha hah ha ha ha.

00:04:28.256 --> 00:04:33.156
Is that like Is that like the post-black ops? It's like the apocalypse after nuclear war?

00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:37.292
How's your aim?

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:41.120
Huh ha hah ha hah hah.

00:04:52.261 --> 00:04:55.450
AP World! AP World!

00:05:12.325 --> 00:05:15.397
Zussman?

00:05:15.397 --> 00:05:20.391
Like suss man but zuss? Zuss man?

00:05:20.391 --> 00:05:25.150
So he's German suss man

00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:28.306
Ha hah hah.

00:06:03.592 --> 00:06:08.503
Wait, do you play it? Wait no, do you play cod for the historic part?

00:06:08.503 --> 00:06:11.489
Or like, the lore.
