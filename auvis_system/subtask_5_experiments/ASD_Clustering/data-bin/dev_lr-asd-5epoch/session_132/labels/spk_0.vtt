WEBVTT

00:00:22.145 --> 00:00:25.758
Superhero? oh!, oh

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:30.752
Ah And like, DC or Marvel? DC um

00:00:30.752 --> 00:00:34.448
See, Loki, I only care about Batman in the entirety of the DC, like...

00:00:34.448 --> 00:00:35.937
Fragile.

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:42.185
Oh, I love those! See I love that he only cares about Batman and his family

00:00:42.147 --> 00:00:45.738
Everybody else can low-key just like disappear laboratory can

00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:49.297
So technically he has four.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.462
Five cannons on it. There's his oldest, they craze

00:00:54.462 --> 00:00:59.169
He only he has one biological son. What biological?

00:00:59.169 --> 00:01:04.278
Huh, No, it's like it's kind of a joke where everybody's like, oh he just takes in children like he will

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:05.346
Hero kidnaps them.

00:01:06.696 --> 00:01:11.505
Literally, that's how it happens every time he's like Batman. He finds a kid on the street. And then

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:16.163
Oh, you're poor and you're also like ah underprivileged I'm gonna 

00:01:16.163 --> 00:01:18.239
Adopt you now. You have no choice.

00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:27.080
Huhu, not low-key, because his basement is a bathtub.

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:31.620
And a lot of people like to also consider

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.616
all the other younger kids that he like interacts with are also his children, so

00:01:36.616 --> 00:01:41.610
If you consider the fanbase, they're like 20 children, basically. 20 children.

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:55.042
There's only one character? Ohh!......

00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:01.355
yeah

00:02:04.038 --> 00:02:06.298
Does you like the TV shows?

00:02:08.307 --> 00:02:11.446
Like, WandaVision and, like, animals and TV shows.

00:02:26.244 --> 00:02:30.177
I know, they're all locked behind Disney+, 

00:02:52.232 --> 00:02:57.590
Huh, huh, ha. They're like, it's not our problem. Oh yeah.

00:02:57.634 --> 00:02:58.849
mmhmm

00:03:06.084 --> 00:03:07.300
mmhmm

00:03:07.926 --> 00:03:09.596
They like then,

00:03:10.735 --> 00:03:15.452
Deterbication. And she just scared ***, your size, yes..

00:03:15.452 --> 00:03:16.869
Only am, so I'm

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.662
Honestly, lowkey, I think it's 

00:03:20.548 --> 00:03:23.720
Marvel has it best when it comes to movies? Not right now, but..

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.939
before, like and then, but like

00:03:28.598 --> 00:03:32.986
When it comes to like series, I think DC kind of has it in the bag.

00:03:32.986 --> 00:03:35.499
Because DC focuses.

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:38.385
Like the movies suck. I watched a few Batman movies.

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:41.592
The only one i like is Robert Pattinson and is like

00:03:41.592 --> 00:03:45.084
Because they didn't focus on the fact that he's Batman. They actually like the story.

00:03:45.084 --> 00:03:48.958
mm, It's like, what was it, 2022? Yeah, 2022.

00:03:50.737 --> 00:03:53.540
Not that one, it's only featuring Batman.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.564
And ah whatever.

00:03:56.475 --> 00:04:00.593
Yeah, I heard about that one too. I think that's maybe the sequel.

00:04:00.998 --> 00:04:03.495
Cuz they're gonna add on to it. But

00:04:03.495 --> 00:04:07.225
The movie is just it is sucks so bad.

00:04:07.225 --> 00:04:11.326
I I watched a few of them, especially like The Flash.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.439
What is it? The Justice League?

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:20.540
And I watched them, it's like, one, the action's really bad, two...

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.332
Their power scaling is crazy. Like they're either like weak or like really weak.

00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:30.326
oh really strong when they need to be. And it's like, so entertaining.

00:04:30.326 --> 00:04:30.427
you

00:04:34.056 --> 00:04:38.005
You know Green Lantern? He Green lantern is limited 

00:04:37.929 --> 00:04:40.587
Fine imagination, But all he does is like

00:04:40.587 --> 00:04:45.582
Gun? Yeah fly and gun and that's about it or giant rock and roll

00:04:49.016 --> 00:04:52.745
You could you could literally do anything

00:04:59.757 --> 00:05:03.013
like a wall sometimes, a wall or a boulder.

00:05:03.013 --> 00:05:06.743
And it's really boring, and it's really sad. So that's why I'm 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:09.680
So, The live-action ones, especially the live-action movies.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.109
They're really bad. I don't like the casting. I hate the casting a lot.

00:05:13.033 --> 00:05:16.666
bad and the costumes are also really bad

00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:21.888
I think I'm just really picky, but I don't like IRL costumes when it comes to superheroes because they never look like 

00:05:21.812 --> 00:05:25.676
Superheroes. They look like costumes. Like you could tell. uh ha

00:05:25.676 --> 00:05:28.072
They don't look real.

00:05:31.549 --> 00:05:36.924
Yeah, I know, the moment they actually look good you believe like, yeah, I don't believe this is a costume. I

00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:38.692
mmhmm

00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:45.200
Oh yeah.

00:05:47.075 --> 00:05:49.980
Like for a costume 

00:05:49.943 --> 00:05:53.972
To be good, I need to be able to watch a movie and not be distracted by the costume and how bad it is.

00:05:53.896 --> 00:05:58.043
It it needs to be like oh I cringe at the costume

00:05:58.043 --> 00:06:02.460
that's a bad music or it's like oh i'm not even i didn't even notice how bad the costume is

00:06:02.422 --> 00:06:04.962
That must be, it just feels magical. Yeah.

00:06:04.962 --> 00:06:09.957
That's what like that's what makes a good superhero costume.

00:06:12.616 --> 00:06:14.834
They're really good.

00:06:16.187 --> 00:06:20.954
Is it Marvel? I've seen... I've seen clips

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.561
yeah
