WEBVTT

00:00:20.027 --> 00:00:21.934
Mm so, kick it to see again.

00:00:28.887 --> 00:00:32.582
Yeah, yeah. It's going great. I love making pieces

00:00:32.582 --> 00:00:35.198
I have one that I'm supposed to make tomorrow.

00:00:35.198 --> 00:00:38.134
I reply*** yes today, I was supposed to make one yesterday, right?

00:00:38.134 --> 00:00:41.184
and then I buff my boss here at school.

00:00:50.657 --> 00:00:55.414
Ssss. It it, who is going ah to robotics?

00:00:55.414 --> 00:00:59.987
Freshman, had the worst, single handedly the worst rhythm and attendance.

00:01:01.286 --> 00:01:04.747
Actually, Ranjin's attendance wasn't bad. Millen's was horrible.

00:01:04.747 --> 00:01:10.375
He was gone for like a week like three weeks before talent show and he was has like probably worse rhythm

00:01:10.296 --> 00:01:14.567
Second worst is, hence is, Tristan Apodario, but he's fine because he actually...

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:18.971
plays Taiko like outside of Taiko, like plays the game and has a sense of rhythm.

00:01:19.394 --> 00:01:20.358
No one does it?

00:01:21.554 --> 00:01:25.334
And then Naranjan, his attendance was great, but like

00:01:25.334 --> 00:01:29.906
For all the meetings we pulled up to, they were regularly like two hour practices.

00:01:29.827 --> 00:01:32.810
It was just me, him, and Kai.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.400
And then it would still happen where he wouldn't be able to fix like a single mistake.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.150
Like we were gonna have the same mistake the entire time for him and he wouldn't be able to figure it.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.780
Oh my god, well, how this sent *** oh cuz he sent a free drive***

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.933
He volunteered for that. He volunteered for it. He was like, you know what?

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:12.061
Actually, Tycho won't be at that much of a deal. I mean, bro.

00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:15.841
But Niranjan got out of the way. He resigned from being a coach.

00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:17.241
Guess who did it?

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:22.961
Oh, Milan got forced to step off anyway because he was sick during ILTs.

00:02:23.595 --> 00:02:27.806
But he still keeps trying to do robotics when he really

00:02:27.806 --> 00:02:31.400
Didn't he do, which was a giant

00:02:35.314 --> 00:02:37.896
They're both programmers from Platform 2.

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.026
Oh, did he *** a part of this?

00:02:49.304 --> 00:02:52.391
Let me see. So there's performance.

00:02:52.391 --> 00:02:56.966
which includes Taekwondo and there's culture which is

00:02:57.437 --> 00:03:00.812
gardening and stuff and I think

00:03:00.812 --> 00:03:03.800
Activities, camps, maybe?

00:03:04.921 --> 00:03:07.377
Yeah, because your DOP, DOC, DOI.

00:03:07.377 --> 00:03:10.532
Activities is like the actual club stuff with like

00:03:10.532 --> 00:03:13.789
General meetings and a banquet and just

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:17.451
the stuff that actually happens that people see really

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.657
Culture ha works with them, I guess.

00:03:20.657 --> 00:03:24.286
And then also there's other stuff like exchange I think. I don't know.

00:03:25.513 --> 00:03:28.977
I don't pay attention during cabin crews very much, I'm not gonna lie.

00:03:35.643 --> 00:03:37.854
Oh yeah, just the outline.

00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:43.473
No like, Jane and Caller are great paladins.

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:46.477
Like they leave the meeting as well and like keep stuff

00:03:46.477 --> 00:03:50.881
organized compared to whatever the hell is going on for robotics.

00:03:50.881 --> 00:03:55.049
Because that's my perspective, I see this and I see that

00:03:55.775 --> 00:03:58.627
So as far as my time is concerned, this is very organized.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.352
We have meetings make it a lot easier to get things done

00:04:03.352 --> 00:04:07.014
And it's also a lot more consistent than whatever the hell robotics is going on.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.910
Yeah, I don't know what was going on that.

00:04:23.955 --> 00:04:29.376
I remember last year it was consistent because they said like oh yeah no just every other week on Monday or whatever

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.950
And this year, I don't know what our current...

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.692
President's arguing.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.958
So it just FTC meeting.

00:05:01.907 --> 00:05:05.636
It's fair enough to be a romantic scene, but also, the rest of the club does matter?

00:05:05.636 --> 00:05:09.671
Because a lot of people rely on it for SNHS stuff.

00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:12.775
And also people, there's a lot of like just middle schoolers back here.

00:05:12.775 --> 00:05:17.770
because they also kind of just put the entirety of middle school on hold for FEC season

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.871
you

00:05:18.513 --> 00:05:23.508
Which they alright, FLO season over. No more FLO stuff. ah mentors didn't do anything, I don't think

00:05:23.508 --> 00:05:28.503
And then we also like we also did a lot less general meetings.

00:05:30.442 --> 00:05:32.384
Yeah, I wonder who's fault that was.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.374
But then, like, that's also a thing a lot of those boys pull up to because they don't have anything else to do with their lives.

00:05:39.792 --> 00:05:44.517
And that also just quite doesn't cook them and ever wants might have

00:05:44.517 --> 00:05:47.352
considerably less of a future in two years.

00:05:53.611 --> 00:05:58.051
No, cuz  already heard about like, they're struggling with mentors for RPIX and Robocamp?

00:06:00.683 --> 00:06:03.248
For sure, I don't think they are anymore but like

00:06:03.248 --> 00:06:07.888
It worked for a bit. I think a lot of middle schoolers who are dedicated just like

00:06:07.888 --> 00:06:12.664
are just grasping for every straw they can and then that's how they get input and stuff

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:16.763
The food's a lot, also a lot, lot of people who just aren't interested in that anymore.

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:19.347
to probably would have been otherwise
