WEBVTT

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.512
So I guess you knew that.

00:01:04.323 --> 00:01:08.069
Uh? New Wave.

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:11.275
UAE

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:14.817
I really want to play

00:01:14.817 --> 00:01:17.990
but I told myself I wouldn't play until they added a character with Melania.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.581
And I'm like the most I have is like slate.

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.841
So it's like in..ah!

00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:30.852
alright

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:46.189
I have been following it. oh, her! okay yeah

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.802
Yes

00:02:07.212 --> 00:02:08.668
Yes!

00:02:18.234 --> 00:02:22.774
I like going around and collecting all the checkpoints before actually starting the class.

00:02:22.774 --> 00:02:26.758
And I swear, some of them were so long, I was just holding W for 5 minutes straight.

00:02:26.758 --> 00:02:31.145
I'm just sprinting for five minutes straight

00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:35.615
yeah like i'll pull out mona to go faster...pull over

00:02:35.615 --> 00:02:38.181
I saw you roll around the dunes.

00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:41.776
I still think it's such a long hike.

00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:55.932
I wanted to start R&R. I want to start R&Yaka.

00:02:55.932 --> 00:02:59.293
and i'm like huh short side quest yeah i'll just do this real quick

00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:03.663
Okay...Haa haa

00:03:03.663 --> 00:03:04.861
Wait which one?

00:03:08.808 --> 00:03:12.050
Is it the dueling one? Oh, it's true.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.045
Oh God

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.525
Wait, wait, is that the one where you get the one sword?

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.788
I like that one. Now...I will...I'm going to be like those people and I'm going to say that.

00:03:40.788 --> 00:03:44.281
They're nice. You should do them. Just do not use their mask.

00:03:44.281 --> 00:03:47.133
Do not use the mask or else you lose it forever.

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.753
You get the recipe comes as a mask

00:03:52.753 --> 00:03:57.748
And the mask is like a sentiment, mental gift from like..the character that dies at the end.

00:03:57.748 --> 00:04:02.641
But if you use it, you lose the mask, just so you can get the recipe for that one sword.

00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:07.484
Unless you really need that sword do not use the mask

00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:13.254
It's literally just a recipe.

00:04:16.192 --> 00:04:21.033
Ha...Haaa

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:24.358
Everybody laptop...ok

00:04:41.555 --> 00:04:45.856
I already saw Genshin, get rid of Genshin

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.969
Haa,,,Haaa,,,,,Are you a Valorant addict too?

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.677
I played like one game ever and then gave up on it.

00:05:03.677 --> 00:05:07.913
because I never wanted to commit like 45 minutes straight of my life to playing Valorant.

00:05:12.824 --> 00:05:17.819
Why would Ryuzo and Chihiro cause each round is like 10 minutes and they can just hop off?

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.694
I'm still not level 10...why not?

00:05:30.694 --> 00:05:35.571
No, I logged in like two days.

00:05:36.398 --> 00:05:40.954
I logged in on Tuesday night because Jack Fu..asked me...told me to add him as a friend.

00:05:40.954 --> 00:05:43.131
And I had to log off to do mock.

00:05:44.718 --> 00:05:48.632
I added, I hopped on for like a second to add.

00:05:48.632 --> 00:05:52.935
jack foo as a friend and then i just didn't hop on again because i had to make more

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:57.610
and then last night it crashed out the second I got home

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:07.196
No, I'm worse because I just tap on Twitter. I don't even play Rivals.

00:06:07.196 --> 00:06:09.946
Then you all know..(***)

00:06:11.194 --> 00:06:12.932
Unfortunately.

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:18.941
You already call it like zitter?

00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:25.876
Aaaa....Elon Musk, stupid job.

00:06:27.158 --> 00:06:32.153
Every time at the end of a speech, he'll jump and try to make the shape of an X.

00:06:32.153 --> 00:06:36.727
And that's why he looks really stupid whenever he jumps yes

00:06:36.727 --> 00:06:41.030
Must be crap...Yeah, he jumps and he's like does that

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.045
He just looks rude

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:52.218
I see random space (***) on Twitter, and I'm like, wow, that looks stupid as fuck. And school passed.

00:06:56.757 --> 00:06:58.833
We weren't supposed to cuss, right?
