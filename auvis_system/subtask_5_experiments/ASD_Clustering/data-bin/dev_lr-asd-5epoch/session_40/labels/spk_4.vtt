00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.225
As Mitchell said...Haa...haaa

00:01:11.228 --> 00:01:14.317
There's a Mitchell Chad...wait did you

00:01:14.317 --> 00:01:18.012
He is ..He's literally been posting so many notes about lamb.

00:01:18.012 --> 00:01:22.533
Like, you're the one who's like, you need to like..ummm

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.049
Exactly, so you gotta hit him up.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.043
Oh my god, you can't just like, no. You have to like actually go for it.

00:01:41.737 --> 00:01:44.944
You would have to develop it, because you're not reaching out to them.

00:01:44.944 --> 00:01:49.518
He's thinking, I tell you he's actually thinking about you. Like if he's putting, he put like...

00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:54.513
I think at least two notes about lamp, right? You..you put them on

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:57.753
Well, you recommended lamp first.

00:01:57.753 --> 00:02:02.191
So if you infer that it was you, like you're the reason.

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.131
Well then he wouldn't have said, like, he wouldn't have said, oh exactly

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:16.449
You put (***) He's thinking about you

00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:23.655
Exactly..yeah

00:02:23.655 --> 00:02:27.504
He's like a sheep, he's following you. Because he is like...

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.614
Yeah, you're like the pack leader. He's like following you.

00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:33.415
Yeah

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:37.795
so that means that if you texted him he would reply and be like

00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:42.117
I'm so in love with you. Please date me.

00:02:46.387 --> 00:02:50.890
Though...But like...you got it like..

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.887
Grab your chance. Like.. It's like being presented right in front of you and you're not taking it.

00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:14.889
Haaa...No, no you see it wrong

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.920
Like, take it from me, trust me.

00:03:23.643 --> 00:03:24.841
ummm

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:34.711
ummm

00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:40.471
Anyways, could you? could you?

00:03:40.447 --> 00:03:44.260
Hear him up. Like look at how he glowed up. He's star right?

00:03:44.283 --> 00:03:49.044
Exactly. And like...He's like a loser

00:03:49.044 --> 00:03:54.038
he's loser enough if he does shake it off...exactly..and then

00:03:59.316 --> 00:04:02.068
He is a (***)

00:04:02.044 --> 00:04:07.038
I..I generally (***) really scared. But he is a (***)

00:04:12.891 --> 00:04:13.784
Yeah!

00:04:19.132 --> 00:04:21.663
So you should pick him up.

00:04:26.084 --> 00:04:28.901
Love knows no bounds.

00:04:31.316 --> 00:04:35.990
Yeah, yeah...that...so

00:04:35.918 --> 00:04:40.913
After this, you better text him. Or I'm gonna text him.

00:04:40.985 --> 00:04:42.757
I am going to text him

00:04:45.252 --> 00:04:48.139
Wait for the post-lamp again and be like...

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.127
Like after the (***)

00:05:22.346 --> 00:05:27.324
Honestly just hit her like I don't care what you do... literally just.... text him

00:05:31.526 --> 00:05:36.233
Music like you know, I love it like music just music...talk about music...

00:05:40.098 --> 00:05:44.367
Lamb, do lamb. I'm telling you. You put, you put big arms.

00:05:44.367 --> 00:05:48.249
So he... that means he must be thinking about you every time he listens to Layout.

00:05:54.036 --> 00:05:56.197
Yeah (***) I like (***)

00:05:59.925 --> 00:06:02.540

I'll be watching you

00:06:22.392 --> 00:06:26.932
I'm gonna text him myself if you don't. You...No one's stopping me.

00:06:26.884 --> 00:06:29.939
If you can't do it I'll do it for you.

00:06:29.963 --> 00:06:34.502
