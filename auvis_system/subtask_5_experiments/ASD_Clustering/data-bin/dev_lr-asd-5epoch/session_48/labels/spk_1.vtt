00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:32.008
Wait, Tegan would fit you very well. 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.121

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:40.261

00:02:01.877 --> 00:02:05.927
I don't really know too. I feel like... I feel like it's hard.

00:02:11.395 --> 00:02:13.695
yeah

00:02:15.537 --> 00:02:16.499
mm

00:02:19.917 --> 00:02:22.886
I feel like Taegon is like

00:02:22.886 --> 00:02:26.094
master student or like senior student.

00:02:26.094 --> 00:02:28.641
I don't know in my head like

00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:32.505
Everyone that I know that play Tigon is all like

00:02:32.505 --> 00:02:35.745
Like in their last couple years of college.

00:02:35.745 --> 00:02:39.796
 Yeah, I don't think I've seen high schoolers play taekwondo.

00:02:39.796 --> 00:02:43.340
 Maybe we grew up in...

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.921
Very different levels.

00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:50.917
oh yeah  

00:02:50.917 --> 00:02:54.832
me

00:02:55.793 --> 00:03:00.501
I feel like well cuz one I'm doing

00:03:00.501 --> 00:03:04.230
the izai 3 right yeah but i also yeah yeah yeah

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.045
I want to learn... I eventually want to learn six.

00:03:10.272 --> 00:03:14.912
Really? ha

00:03:14.936 --> 00:03:18.041
I feel like six fits him

00:03:18.558 --> 00:03:22.185
It's very, like, fiery.

00:03:22.355 --> 00:03:26.809
yeah Do you have other things?

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:28.901
yeah

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.264
huh ha

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:39.500
oh yeah

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.988
That would be fun. Yeah. It sounds fun.

00:03:43.988 --> 00:03:45.862
Yeah yeah yeah.

00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:53.613
(***)

00:03:53.674 --> 00:03:58.518
Yeah, it's like the very flashy.  It's very cool.

00:03:58.518 --> 00:04:02.601
I don't think you should pitch the idea.

00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:05.740
oh Really

00:04:14.984 --> 00:04:16.204
mmmm

00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:18.059
yeah

00:04:19.763 --> 00:04:22.278
I think you can...

00:04:22.278 --> 00:04:26.547
like mention it here and there but like last year I didn't really have a choice

00:04:26.547 --> 00:04:27.999
sshhh

00:04:38.643 --> 00:04:40.638
ohhh

00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:47.607
Yeah, okay

00:04:47.966 --> 00:04:50.130
huhh

00:04:50.476 --> 00:04:54.745
But but if you're with Barney, sometimes he's a little more like me.

00:04:54.745 --> 00:04:59.740
I see. I think. Because like the Prokofiev concerto?

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.301
Like i (***)

00:05:03.301 --> 00:05:06.457
It was just like Farty being like, oh, you should start this.

00:05:06.457 --> 00:05:09.950
Just get the music and start it and then I'll see you next week kind of thing

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.899
That's what I did with her. I didn't really talk with Pugosi after.

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:16.935
I think she found out after a couple weeks.

00:05:16.935 --> 00:05:19.856
like after my first two weeks of learning it with Barney.

00:05:19.856 --> 00:05:22.370
So I think yeah

00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:26.332
Mmm

00:05:30.192 --> 00:05:31.665
sshhh

00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:41.781
mmmm

00:05:47.024 --> 00:05:49.134
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:51.834 --> 00:05:53.622
Oh ohhhh

00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:01.049
Mmmm

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.122
Huhhhhhhh

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.966
Okay, well, (***)

00:06:11.966 --> 00:06:16.099
yeah  it's a very lyrical  yeah yeah

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:19.154
That's what I did too.

00:06:19.154 --> 00:06:22.731
She knows but like last year I didn't do any

00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:26.394
Concerto. no park

00:06:26.394 --> 00:06:28.959
it was all lyrical and technique

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:33.937
And then the last like 2-3 weeks it was like, oh you should do the percoflate first.

00:06:33.937 --> 00:06:38.053
But I feel like

00:06:38.053 --> 00:06:43.048
They'll probably let you start having a say a little earlier since

00:06:43.048 --> 00:06:47.690
Yeah, masters

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.824
yeah

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:59.856
thats all
