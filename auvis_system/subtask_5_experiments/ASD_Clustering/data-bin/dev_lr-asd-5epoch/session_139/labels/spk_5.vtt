00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:18.528
guys my thoughts and opinions on

00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:24.384
Yeah, outsiders. Basically soda pop was super duper bad

00:00:24.384 --> 00:00:26.931
He's really hot.

00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:30.559
and i thought he was like a d1 daddy um

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:33.681
And then on top of that, I thought the whole plot...

00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:37.495
Not the plot, but the general message of the book was a little bit stupid.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:40.044
because like the poor people.

00:00:40.044 --> 00:00:43.199
Literally got like killed and like hate crimes could be like (***)

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.132
But then the rich people were like, oh, but uh you don't get it.

00:00:47.132 --> 00:00:51.485
We're not allowed to have emotions. I just thought it was really stupid and stuff.

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:54.437
Except for that one rich kid that got stabbed to death.

00:00:54.437 --> 00:00:56.952
Like , Yeahhhh..

00:00:56.952 --> 00:01:01.846
But that ,that's ,that was like  a one-time occurrence compared to like so many other things that happen

00:01:01.846 --> 00:01:04.985
That's it. That's my thoughts. Okay

00:01:04.985 --> 00:01:07.989
Okay. Ohhhh.... Oh.

00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:11.077
Yeah.

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:17.220
Okay, I'm sorry. My sincerest apologies.

00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:23.125
So it (***) boy what? ,Hahaha . So

00:01:33.015 --> 00:01:35.057
I've never heard 

00:01:39.545 --> 00:01:40.828
That's just you.

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:49.113
What else?  Oh I read Romeo and Juliet.

00:01:49.113 --> 00:01:51.998
Really? Oh wow

00:01:55.491 --> 00:02:00.116
It was okay. Yeah, Yeah, yeah.

00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:14.342
No, 8th grade is the (***) 7th grade is the outsider.

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:16.079
and Malala.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.079
But a four.

00:02:21.192 --> 00:02:24.078
Really? I don't know, like three or four is more like it.

00:02:25.547 --> 00:02:27.604
I remember it, yeah.

00:02:31.014 --> 00:02:34.085
I felt bad when the horse died.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.114
The one who was like guys like I don't care. I just want to look pretty like that's it

00:02:39.114 --> 00:02:43.062
her i felt bad when she died i think she died

00:02:48.057 --> 00:02:50.824
So tough, so tough, so tough, so tough.

00:02:51.128 --> 00:02:55.246
And then when they stood up on two legs and you can't distinguish man from pig.

00:02:55.246 --> 00:02:58.992
Ooooooo........

00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:13.437
Who is Kobe Bryant? Who is LeBron James?

00:03:15.901 --> 00:03:18.972
Oh! Oh! Oh! Cross! Cross over! Cross over! Cross over!

00:03:18.972 --> 00:03:22.078
That one was tough. I cried reading that. That was tough.

00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:31.021
Dad, dad, dad. That was sad. That was sad.

00:03:47.053 --> 00:03:47.964
Yeah.

00:03:59.996 --> 00:04:04.990
Oh my god, I still have my fifth grade teacher's copy of that, but then we had COVID.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.158
So I never gave it back to her. Yeah, it's fun.

00:04:09.412 --> 00:04:12.078
I liked that book I think.

00:04:12.078 --> 00:04:14.794
Me too, but there's a bridge

00:04:14.794 --> 00:04:18.002
And there's like this doll right like this bunny doll

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.823
And then there's like a bridge and then Terabithia is like the other world, right?

00:04:25.967 --> 00:04:28.059
Ohhh

00:04:30.876 --> 00:04:34.842
It was a very, like, imaginatory imaginative.

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:43.397
That sounds familiar.

00:04:47.549 --> 00:04:49.220
Probably. It's been a while.

00:04:53.118 --> 00:04:55.616
Hahahahahha

00:05:00.407 --> 00:05:04.965
I've never read it before. Why don't you buy it since you're on your own?

00:05:21.518 --> 00:05:23.087
That is quite sad.

00:05:25.772 --> 00:05:30.749
I was also agreeing, like in genuine ,genuinity

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:35.001
I have a series

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.772
I bet you don't like it because the main character is a girl.

00:05:40.772 --> 00:05:42.595
Yeah I wonder why.

00:05:49.075 --> 00:05:50.308
Haahaahaa..

00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:54.272
You just couldn't relate to her experiences.

00:05:56.027 --> 00:05:59.893
But, Hahahaha .Yeah

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.705
Woah, what? He just does a face like, I look like a blue dolphin.

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:11.941
