00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:15.663
I don't remember anything

00:01:16.506 --> 00:01:18.433

Walk to Moose. Walk to Moose.

00:01:34.478 --> 00:01:39.424
Yeah, it's from- it's from my old district.

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.392
Nuh uh..

00:01:45.431 --> 00:01:47.371
Romeo and Juliet

00:01:56.348 --> 00:02:01.041
It was like, it's like it's what you expect, to be honest.

00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:03.998
Uhhhmmmmm...

00:02:05.023 --> 00:02:08.904
Wait, there's...oh. 7th grade is...the giver.

Right? 8th grade is the year-

00:02:20.378 --> 00:02:25.374
Four books? Animal Fox?

00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:31.465
I- I liked it.

00:02:34.132 --> 00:02:35.618
The old one?

00:02:40.832 --> 00:02:43.548

00:02:49.354 --> 00:02:52.325
(***)

00:03:02.971 --> 00:03:05.891
Have any contributions to this discussion?

00:03:12.533 --> 00:03:15.183

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:55.885
Haahaa

00:04:06.554 --> 00:04:08.000
Hahah

00:04:24.073 --> 00:04:25.491
What? 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:29.607
I never went to...

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:36.061

00:04:48.323 --> 00:04:52.828
I know one . I (***) in the shower

00:04:52.828 --> 00:04:56.506
It was about an hour in the shower

00:04:56.506 --> 00:05:00.506
And we never freaking finished it. We never finished it.

00:05:00.506 --> 00:05:02.446
It was so good.

00:05:05.316 --> 00:05:09.972
That's true. Oh, I don't know. No, it's like they're great.

00:05:09.972 --> 00:05:14.174
She was reading it to us. She was like, oh, that was so good.

00:05:14.174 --> 00:05:17.229
And she was like, oh, we don't have any time this year.

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.431
Hahaha...This is dumb!

00:05:25.177 --> 00:05:29.581
Thank you. Thank you.

00:05:34.685 --> 00:05:36.669
I tried.

00:05:38.491 --> 00:05:42.188
No, it- It was like hard to understand

00:05:42.407 --> 00:05:44.972
No, it's like

00:05:44.972 --> 00:05:49.056
It was a Tesseract 4D.

00:05:49.056 --> 00:05:51.823
Not because there's a woman.

00:05:55.366 --> 00:05:58.792
What woman? 

00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:01.763
Okay, wait

00:06:03.078 --> 00:06:07.736
Like, what books even have open SME kits?

00:06:07.736 --> 00:06:11.819
No, I'm just wondering. Island of the Blue Dolphins.

00:06:12.578 --> 00:06:17.523
