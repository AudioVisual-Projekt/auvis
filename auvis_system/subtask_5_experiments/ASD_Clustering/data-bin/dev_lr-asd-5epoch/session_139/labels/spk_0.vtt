00:00:15.457 --> 00:00:20.472

00:00:20.472 --> 00:00:24.084
Can we go off of call of duty? How do you guys feel about roblox?

00:00:24.084 --> 00:00:26.733
What's- . How do you guys feel about Roblox?

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:31.373

00:00:32.672 --> 00:00:36.706
Adopt me? Adop-  Wait, did you play ,adopt me?

00:00:40.453 --> 00:00:45.060
Haha. It's just one of those generic games. It's one of those generic -

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.405
What about you love?

00:00:47.692 --> 00:00:50.189
(***),Don't -don't touch that.

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:55.185

00:00:55.185 --> 00:00:55.268

00:01:05.343 --> 00:01:08.280
The children yearn for the moss.

00:01:14.978 --> 00:01:19.653
Was it limited time? So it was limited time.

00:01:19.653 --> 00:01:23.298
Oh... oh I had it in event .Okay.

00:01:26.234 --> 00:01:27.450
(***), you see?

00:01:31.128 --> 00:01:33.203
walk to (***)

00:01:37.236 --> 00:01:40.307
Oh, they are. I like Michael Zombies. That one's fun.

00:01:40.307 --> 00:01:43.961
 so Michael zombies is one where you spawn like it guess like it's usually like Micheal

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:47.040
(***)It was like a Cracker Barrel restaurant, but then there's zombies.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.361
And then basically you get power-ups from like feed like vending machines.

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:56.355
Yes, but it's - this one's kind of silly. It's like pretty silly.

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.334
It has a cat. . Michael's cat.Yeah.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.763
I used to be so good at tower of (***).

00:02:11.763 --> 00:02:15.509
I used to be so good at it, and they added too many new stages that I fell off.

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:18.935
I can't really-i can't really ,Too many new stages.

00:02:18.935 --> 00:02:21.365
New levels, yeah. And then I forgot.

00:02:23.457 --> 00:02:27.305
I'm so good at-.uh uh . My high score in run four is like 17 minutes.

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:43.336
What,The arrow key?

00:02:46.187 --> 00:02:47.834
Did you check your settings?

00:02:53.613 --> 00:02:58.152
It's run for it. It's like, that takes like .

00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:05.425
Wait.I love run for it. I play it when I'm like, like you know

00:03:05.425 --> 00:03:08.649
Wait you know like the subway surfers like backgrounds

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:13.508
like that's my type of thing like whenever i need to zone out ,i just play it

00:03:14.488 --> 00:03:17.457
No. I mean I did, but I wasn't that-

00:03:18.858 --> 00:03:23.582
Did you like Cut the Rope? Cut the Rope, the little green alien? 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.435
A little bit.

00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:31.413
Five nights (***)JETPACK JOYRIDE !!!. I was so bad at it.Yeah

00:03:33.707 --> 00:03:36.205
What about five (***)?

00:03:36.205 --> 00:03:39.800
Me neither.I haven't really touched (**) like that.

00:03:47.157 --> 00:03:50.515
That so real. Wait, what? 

00:03:50.515 --> 00:03:53.131
No,What is that?

00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:57.603
You know break into? It's like- it's like one of the little story game

00:03:57.603 --> 00:04:01.198
It's a really like, stereotypical

00:04:04.387 --> 00:04:07.167
(***) roblox story.Yeah.

00:04:06.884 --> 00:04:09.466
It's called break into it's really

00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:13.009
It was really poppy for the first time, so for me, I just play it whenever I feel nostalgic.

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:17.127
But it's really silly. It's like like you're in a house with all the other players.

00:04:17.127 --> 00:04:22.122
like it's like move-in day , and then it's kind of like a version of the purge

00:04:22.122 --> 00:04:26.627
I like this group of, like, basically gangsters. They just come and terrorize you.

00:04:26.627 --> 00:04:29.497
Except that Purge lasts multiple days.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.242
Yeah, yeah. 

00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:37.360
Yeah, I know right?

00:04:41.968 --> 00:04:44.464
oh i've heard of that one

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:53.459
(***).Yeah.Wait,did you guys -

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:59.923
It takes a long time. It takes a long time.  Do you guys have Flickr?

00:04:59.923 --> 00:05:05.845
You ever- it's basically like ,So it's it's basically just like werewolf so you're assigned a role

00:05:04.918 --> 00:05:09.795
That's true. So there's good side and bad side. And then you're side or wrong. So like for the good side, there's like

00:05:09.795 --> 00:05:14.250
Which is like you can protect it to us for one night

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.303
Yeah it's like (***)

00:05:17.303 --> 00:05:21.420
Hahaha..Mafia are werewolves and then...

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.694
But instead of only like the two or one of

00:05:24.694 --> 00:05:29.689
to like bad people. There's actually multiple roles for the villain side, so there's like

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:30.533
One.

00:05:32.204 --> 00:05:35.730
(***) more complex. And then you talk in between.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.591
and then each night stuff happens, stuff like that. It's actually really fun.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.658
No, I haven't played that.It's (***)

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.668
Guys, have you played Sky Children of the Light?

00:06:01.668 --> 00:06:05.802
Sky, Children of the Light. It's so cuuuute!

00:06:05.802 --> 00:06:08.367
I had like a one month...

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:13.228
I had a one month phase where I- did it like there was no tomorrow.
