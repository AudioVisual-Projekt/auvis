WEBVTT

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.538
Oh, do you wanna...

00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:23.773
I think I was talking about the costumes cinderella 

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:26.344
And so that's why...

00:00:26.372 --> 00:00:29.360
No, I mean the costumes it wasn't always the CGI that got me

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.127
but I think the costumes and the design of the characters

00:00:32.127 --> 00:00:34.978
I would love it. It's so good.

00:00:34.978 --> 00:00:38.606
Because when it comes to live action Disney costumes, they all look bad.

00:00:41.392 --> 00:00:46.117
I saw the Snow White dress and I was like, no what did they do to my baby girl.

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:54.773
I know, right? They literally made the worst...

00:00:54.773 --> 00:00:56.966
Dress

00:01:03.194 --> 00:01:06.940
Also, I heard they're changing the plot.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.589
You know what I don't get about...

00:01:09.589 --> 00:01:14.584
 the whole like we are gonna change this disney (**) So they're more like empowered

00:01:14.584 --> 00:01:18.770
But the thing is, most of them are already technically empowered women.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.765
They're just in more feminine forms and it's very strange how

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:28.759
They have no literacy like

00:01:28.731 --> 00:01:33.726
media literacy in them because a lot of these stories about people

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:38.721
Like, getting a better life, generally, right? Isn't that empowerment in some sort of way?

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.226
and she has to be independent.

00:01:42.226 --> 00:01:45.011
She has to be girl boss.

00:01:44.982 --> 00:01:48.458
Like she makes no math.

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:52.159
Like that type of

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:03.101
Yeah yeah 

00:02:03.101 --> 00:02:07.976
There's so many actors with dwarfism out there. It's not that hard. like

00:02:07.976 --> 00:02:12.939
 one of the actresss was like oh One of the producers like that's offensive

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.314
like people yeah

00:02:18.187 --> 00:02:22.473
So like I don't get why they didn't bother doing it. It's so strange.

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:28.648
No, the actors are fine, but it's the producers that are always so strange. Or like, it's the company.

00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:44.343
i ummmm

00:02:45.338 --> 00:02:49.945
Okay, I don't like how they basically

00:02:49.945 --> 00:02:52.713
i didnt really like that

00:02:53.303 --> 00:02:57.606
Because by the time he gets, like, if there's still continue

00:02:57.607 --> 00:03:01.724
Yeah, the whole point of the ending of the book is that he goes to college.

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:09.284
he's gonna have like yeah he's buying his own life insurance

00:03:09.284 --> 00:03:11.360
hahahah

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.814
Have you seen the new, like, what was it, the new Percy Jackson stuff?

00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:19.678
show was it a show or was it like?

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.194
Huh?

00:03:22.194 --> 00:03:25.265
ohhh true ur right

00:03:33.837 --> 00:03:36.217
They have two?

00:03:40.081 --> 00:03:42.578
Wait, there's no awesome way.

00:03:42.578 --> 00:03:45.903
Is this an animated one?like

00:03:45.903 --> 00:03:49.194
It's so good!

00:03:49.194 --> 00:03:52.332
No, I wasnt the first one

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.885
I love Nezha and Liar. You know, like, Green Snake? And, like...

00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:07.790
ohhhhh It's so good!

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.861
 the first one?

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.281
Oh yeah, I was like, this is a little strange

00:04:34.132 --> 00:04:37.068
How do you feel?(***)

00:04:41.202 --> 00:04:42.298
Really?

00:04:48.064 --> 00:04:50.157
It's like water and milk.

00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:59.984
The style is always strange like every time I watch it

00:05:01.013 --> 00:05:06.008
My dad and I watch it all the time and he's like, this style is very geared towards a certain audience.

00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:17.315
Didn't you hear the pause? It's kind of boring.

00:05:17.315 --> 00:05:19.880
really boring

00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:25.145
Have you seen, oh shoot, I don't know what the name of the movie is.

00:05:25.145 --> 00:05:28.317
But it's this Chinese animated movie.

00:05:28.317 --> 00:05:31.354
Oh, this is like little kid.

00:05:31.354 --> 00:05:36.315
And he has like a change into like an animal and he has like an older mentor

00:05:36.315 --> 00:05:38.020
And it's really cute.

00:05:39.168 --> 00:05:44.061
Huh? Not the monkey king. It's like an actual 2D animated.

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:51.739
It's really cute. It's actually, I watched it and I was like, ooh, this is such a good movie. The animation's so good.

00:05:51.739 --> 00:05:56.734
The impact frames are incredible. My seats are wonderful.

00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:02.196
If I can find it, I'll show it to you. It's really good.

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:13.247
hm?
