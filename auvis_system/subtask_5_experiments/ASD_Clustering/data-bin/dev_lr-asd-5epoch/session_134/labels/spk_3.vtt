WEBVTT

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.307
So you should start with something. That's why I pointed at you.

00:00:24.343 --> 00:00:28.663
Oh, I started last time. No, I did.no

00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:32.055
Okay, so um

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:36.957
What do you think your favorite memory has been in robotics? Favorite and least favorite.

00:00:38.636 --> 00:00:39.311
Yeah.

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:06.631
Any other time of what?ohh

00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:31.736
Did you go to any of the after school meetings? Did you go to any of the home meetings?

00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:37.570
But I thought it's, like, not required.

00:01:54.052 --> 00:01:57.224
Cuz Mahana was telling me yeah, she was complaining because

00:01:57.224 --> 00:02:02.219
like robotics like trash your house and she was the one who had to create all of the backup

00:02:03.714 --> 00:02:08.152
Like, because Moana was telling me that, like, robotics completely, like, trashed her.

00:02:08.124 --> 00:02:11.617
And she was the one who had to clean everything back up.

00:02:26.637 --> 00:02:30.569
Who's on team 2?whos on  team 2

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:37.606
Yeah, don't worry I get the

00:02:37.927 --> 00:02:42.010
the vibe of the team now.

00:02:45.536 --> 00:02:46.684
Team two?

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:51.977
oh interesting 

00:02:58.693 --> 00:02:59.824
I see you

00:03:03.762 --> 00:03:08.200
are you um planning oh no you're probably not but you're probably not 

00:03:08.172 --> 00:03:10.754
(****)

00:03:10.754 --> 00:03:15.749
You're probably not going to do RoboCamp this year.i think so yeah

00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:33.934
That's fair.

00:03:42.743 --> 00:03:47.316
heck no H-E-C-K-N-O

00:03:47.704 --> 00:03:51.079
My friend told me that robotics is like a god.

00:03:51.052 --> 00:03:54.899
And I was like talking about robotics the same way I talked about that guy.

00:03:54.927 --> 00:03:56.816
he's like blocking on everything

00:04:00.466 --> 00:04:03.537
its so toxic bro

00:04:06.605 --> 00:04:09.371
The most toxic- Oh, I like- Oh!

00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:13.523
Whenever I kept like I literally planned all of the days

00:04:13.523 --> 00:04:16.831
and all the stuff from the J-O meetings, right? And then they literally just...

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.026
And then they're like, oh, by the way, the master calendar.

00:04:20.053 --> 00:04:23.125
The secretaries are supposed to make that. I don't even...

00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:26.179
Like, I just look over it, but the second thing is his makeup.

00:04:26.179 --> 00:04:30.415
So why are you asking me to make it when the secretaries were supposed to make it at the very start of the year?

00:04:30.442 --> 00:04:34.543
Because last year I was secretary, I was helping Chris make the master calendar too.

00:04:34.488 --> 00:04:38.943
And then on top of that, I had all of his gender names, and I talked to Johnson about it, and I was like, hey, this is okay.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.915
and I planned out what to do and then the day that the general duties actually come were actually a couple days ago.

00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:47.441
Like oh sorry can we do like this like no

00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:50.782
I don't think wecan do like this

00:04:53.686 --> 00:04:57.263
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no. It's Audit and Hoonion.

00:05:03.607 --> 00:05:05.819
yes

00:05:06.967 --> 00:05:11.540
dude right and then as soon i found i wasnt in the...

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.420
okay i am just gonna lock outLike what's the point?

00:05:15.421 --> 00:05:17.935
Trying to like yeah

00:05:17.934 --> 00:05:22.929
Trying to put myself there when they obviously like don't want me there. You know what I mean?

00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:26.422
Like don't don't try to invite yourself to parties that you're

00:05:26.422 --> 00:05:28.684
that you didn't get invited to.

00:05:38.336 --> 00:05:39.585
King alumni.

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:50.189
(****)

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:53.480
Apparently this is like way like a while back

00:05:53.508 --> 00:05:58.148
But, like, basically, they sent, like, an email to Perry Han, and they're like,

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.652
Here are some problems we have with the club.

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:05.270
What is your advice and he basically said yeah, the whole club is like screwed

00:06:07.328 --> 00:06:11.058
so basically um like someone or like i think it was

00:06:11.345 --> 00:06:16.340
you're like an email to Perry Han you know Perry Han Loki was

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.980
he was like.
