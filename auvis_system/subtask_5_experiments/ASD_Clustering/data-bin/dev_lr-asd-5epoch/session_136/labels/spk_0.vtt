WEBVTT

00:00:05.246 --> 00:00:06.579
Where were we

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.401
Yes! Oh my gosh, how do you feel about that one?

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.636
Like I didn't cry the first time around.

00:00:26.407 --> 00:00:31.401
Guardians of the Galaxy. Those are silly. They're so silly.

00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:35.992
I know. I love them. Oh! Have you seen the most recent one?

00:00:35.992 --> 00:00:39.182
Guaurdians...guardians of (***)

00:00:39.182 --> 00:00:42.033
I heard it's really sad. I haven't watched it.

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:45.830
Like a lot of (***) basically

00:00:48.344 --> 00:00:50.959
I think I think you should watch it. I think you'll love it.

00:00:51.315 --> 00:00:54.538
I really want to...umm..

00:00:55.736 --> 00:00:58.909
I watched Infinity War and

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.739
Endgame and then I went back and watched the rest of them.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.350
like we're in the same boat basically we're in the same boat but i actually won

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.865
back and watch like all the rest of them.

00:01:08.865 --> 00:01:13.859
because like low-key i watched a lot of them last year all the way to japan

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:18.094
 Um, on the plane, but they didn't have several I think

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:23.073
civil war which is what i need it's what i was missing..(***)

00:01:23.073 --> 00:01:28.069
I watched those...but I have to 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:32.793
The first one? The first Avenger. That's good, that's a good one.

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:37.669
Have you seen my girl? She's an escalator. But um. 

00:01:38.496 --> 00:01:43.459
After I watched all of them back, I came back to the VR and N-Gage.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:48.454
And I was like, wow, that really sucks because the timeline here is... So can I do spoilers?

00:01:48.454 --> 00:01:52.858
Yeah, so the timeline is that they..

00:01:54.174 --> 00:01:56.790
Their group gets formed.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.754
And then, like, stuff happens. They fight people.

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:05.750
And then they separate. And when they separate, the next movie...

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.260
of them together of the Avengers is

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.893
Affinity War? So...

00:02:11.893 --> 00:02:15.351
That's why they come back together to work as a team again.

00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:19.976
but in between that they're all getting like individual stuff done but they come back together

00:02:19.976 --> 00:02:24.279
as a team again, but then they literally just like fought.

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:28.262
Like really really bad because it's like 2016 to 2019

00:02:28.262 --> 00:02:31.957
I believe Or, no, 2018.

00:02:31.957 --> 00:02:34.505
No, 2018 was so ended. 

00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:37.475
no no 2018 isn't. They (***) you are

00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:40.665
(***) 2026

00:02:40.665 --> 00:02:45.169
So yeah, so basically for the last two years before Infinity War

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:50.165
They've all been separated. And that's why the tension is so high. It's so sad because...

00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:55.160
They literally fought and then they come back together but only to save the world again

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.155
And then right after that, they just go right back to arguing. They never go back to being friends.

00:03:00.155 --> 00:03:05.048
and then someone dies...or something...does someone

00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:10.250
I some of them leave...They literally just and I was like, yeah I was so sad

00:03:22.328 --> 00:03:27.206
I'm glad they ended it at endgame for the Avengers fans. 

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:31.964
I am glad they ended it. Uh...but I'm gonna miss it so bad..like

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:36.514
Ahw! It was so cute. It was so good.

00:03:39.422 --> 00:03:41.275
star check?

00:03:41.363 --> 00:03:45.869
I didnt watch Star Wars. The only Star Wars movie I watched was where...

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:49.886
Kylo Ren and Rey kiss at the end, and then...

00:03:49.886 --> 00:03:54.846
I was like, oh, aren't they siblings? And my dad was like, yeah, but it's Star Wars.

00:03:54.846 --> 00:03:58.577
Haaa...it is thats very (***)

00:03:58.643 --> 00:04:01.579
like...yeah...right

00:04:03.822 --> 00:04:05.051
Yeah!

00:04:05.107 --> 00:04:08.667
I don't know what it was, but I know it was another like...

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:13.342
movie with the same name as like another movie from 20 years ago.

00:04:13.342 --> 00:04:14.708
(***)

00:04:15.383 --> 00:04:20.362
It was okay, I don't remember it at all. I remember the cinematography was pretty good.

00:04:20.362 --> 00:04:21.729
That's too much.

00:04:24.412 --> 00:04:29.407
Which means..Star wars?

00:04:32.376 --> 00:04:38.304
Oh! How many are there? 9? um...

00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:43.828
Haaaa

00:04:44.982 --> 00:04:48.948
I love Lego Star Wars games. Okay, so I'm gonna have some of that now.

00:04:48.948 --> 00:04:53.453
Ha...Haaa...What other ladies do that?

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.390
Oh! wait wait (***)

00:05:06.976 --> 00:05:10.908
ok...Like to be fair some of them really good..yeah

00:05:20.447 --> 00:05:22.144
What is that?

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.191
oh this is the one you were talking about and (***)

00:05:45.513 --> 00:05:48.669
Yeah no, I feel so like artificial

00:05:53.073 --> 00:05:54.525
Is it like comedy?
