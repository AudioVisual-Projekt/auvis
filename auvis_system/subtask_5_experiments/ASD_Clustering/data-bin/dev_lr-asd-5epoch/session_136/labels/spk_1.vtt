00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:09.090
Hmm...We're talking about Infinity War.

00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:14.542
Ohw! That was okay. I mean

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:17.917
I didn't really cry because I didn't know half the characters.

00:00:20.128 --> 00:00:22.980
Ohw! actually, I watch...

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.018
What was the space guys again?

00:00:26.963 --> 00:00:31.637
The Guardians of the Galaxy, I'm watch them. Oh, they're good. They're so funny.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.228
How's that? Ohw!!...No

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:47.938
Ohw! I don't know...I don't know anything about it. wow

00:00:50.073 --> 00:00:52.060
Hm...hmmmm

00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:56.746
Alright.

00:01:01.792 --> 00:01:06.787
Ha haaa....That's what I'm trying to do it

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.372
Hm..hmmm

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:15.882
Ohw!

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.955
Ohw!

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.070
I watched the Captain America movie. Like the first one.

00:01:31.106 --> 00:01:36.151
I think thats it. I think thats it..lot of them (***) Galaxy. Haaan?

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:52.924
I already know what this is.

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.098
Hmm hmmm

00:02:09.574 --> 00:02:11.387
Hmm hmmm

00:02:15.078 --> 00:02:16.999
Ohw!

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:41.955
Hmm hmmm

00:02:57.952 --> 00:02:59.546
Haa haaa

00:03:02.668 --> 00:03:06.668
Or something. Or something.

00:03:11.038 --> 00:03:15.156
Honestly? I feel like...

00:03:15.594 --> 00:03:21.264
Movie serious? I feel like they are only good as long as they don't stretch it out for too long.

00:03:25.542 --> 00:03:26.614
Yeah!

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.764
What do you think of like the Star Wars? (***) do you like three above?

00:03:39.742 --> 00:03:41.379
Star Wars.

00:03:48.482 --> 00:03:50.728
are the bad one?

00:03:57.738 --> 00:04:02.733
I dont know...(***) Oh the other way never mind

00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:05.026
Aaam....

00:04:13.483 --> 00:04:16.495
Haaa.haaaa...Ummm

00:04:17.661 --> 00:04:19.146
Ok

00:04:20.817 --> 00:04:23.331
I don't know Star Wars like...

00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:28.038
There's two trilogies, like book one through six. I think they're okay. They're good.

00:04:28.038 --> 00:04:33.033
Ah..like..1 through 6 cuz there's like the prequels and the actual trilogy

00:04:33.012 --> 00:04:37.315
Uh, there's like nine...Nine and one

00:04:37.336 --> 00:04:41.910
But I prefer the shows actually, they do a lot better than those.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.879
Like, the movies are a good fun though

00:04:47.966 --> 00:04:49.975
Haa haaa

00:04:53.436 --> 00:04:56.845
I watch just a lot of historical movies..(***)

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.536
Um....

00:05:02.632 --> 00:05:06.901
(***) two because it's the most popular genre of movie.

00:05:09.374 --> 00:05:11.034
They are...

00:05:12.128 --> 00:05:14.290
Um...

00:05:15.853 --> 00:05:20.605
You know...there is actually a live adaptation of a manga and anime.

00:05:20.605 --> 00:05:25.060
Its..It's called Uh...Golden Calamary.

00:05:26.697 --> 00:05:31.454
Yeah, it's the first movie adaptation I did it was so good

00:05:31.454 --> 00:05:35.185
The casting? 8. The setting?

00:05:35.185 --> 00:05:37.884
The storyline, they did such a good job.

00:05:37.884 --> 00:05:40.584
They were so good at it. Normally...

00:05:40.584 --> 00:05:43.942
like live action movies of animes or mangas

00:05:43.942 --> 00:05:47.841
FaceTalk. You're always so bad.

00:05:47.841 --> 00:05:51.334
But this one is like they like played up however

00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:54.675
Ridiculous it is but they also kept like some of the actual serious tone

00:05:54.675 --> 00:05:59.485
Animes and Mangas looks like a comedy.. With like serious circle tone

00:05:59.485 --> 00:06:03.129
What are they gonna do? She's just getting carried away.

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:05.862
Weird? Weird!
