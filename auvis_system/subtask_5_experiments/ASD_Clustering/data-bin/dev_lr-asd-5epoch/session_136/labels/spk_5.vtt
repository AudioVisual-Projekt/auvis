So..was it...so last year they made regionals.

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.070

00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:55.945
I see I see.

00:03:08.786 --> 00:03:11.993
Yeah, because there's nobody else working on it besides you.

00:03:11.993 --> 00:03:15.013
Because there's nobody else working on it besides you.

00:03:19.603 --> 00:03:20.869
Which has all been what?

00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:31.867

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.917
That's why what?

00:04:02.563 --> 00:04:04.981
Oh, Oh! I see

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.667

00:04:30.157 --> 00:04:32.909
Like tearing friendships

00:04:34.815 --> 00:04:35.930

00:05:28.376 --> 00:05:32.224
Her projects are always super good, like her slides are always very well designed.

00:05:32.224 --> 00:05:35.245
and like like we have like the memory of projecting

00:05:35.245 --> 00:05:39.767
Like, which is really good, too. And I feel like I just put, like, their effort, like...

00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:42.046
