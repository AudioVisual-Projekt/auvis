00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:19.394
Okay.

00:00:20.104 --> 00:00:23.900
Do you guys like orchestra class?

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.521
At all.

00:00:28.423 --> 00:00:30.701
I was just wondering.

00:00:36.928 --> 00:00:37.890
ahh

00:00:40.742 --> 00:00:45.736
Is it because like people practice and they're ready and like the conductor's also like...

00:00:48.647 --> 00:00:49.928
ahh

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:55.001
yes yes

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:01.919

00:01:23.992 --> 00:01:25.038
Yeah

00:01:34.353 --> 00:01:36.348
ha ha

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.711
(***) like  (***)

00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:09.606
Did you guys have like a California orchestra?

00:02:09.606 --> 00:02:14.111
For me, it's called IMEA. (***)

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:19.494
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (***)

00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:22.380
That was really fun. 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.961
Yeah.

00:02:27.982 --> 00:02:28.656
Yeah.

00:02:39.085 --> 00:02:42.191
What do you guys think about contemporary music?

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.698
I just don't find that as fascinating as like

00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:50.155
Like, I think for me, Ori's straw depends on what rep you're playing.

00:02:50.155 --> 00:02:52.873
I would not enjoy it if we're just playing.

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:56.113

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:17.096
One thing I was surprised when I got here

00:04:17.096 --> 00:04:20.757
Don't you think UCLA Artists Draw?

00:04:21.028 --> 00:04:23.964
Absence policy is very nice here. I don't know.

00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:26.748
But like, back at my place?

00:04:26.748 --> 00:04:31.574
Really? At U of I? Like, you cannot miss any.

00:04:31.574 --> 00:04:33.801
For every sickness, they'll be like

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:37.767
Give me a doctor's note. But here, I feel like...

00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:42.122

00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:43.908

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:56.971
I see.

00:05:27.211 --> 00:05:29.995
I think Ally also told me she like

00:05:29.995 --> 00:05:34.906
looks at the emails too. You know what shocked me? To like

00:05:34.906 --> 00:05:39.209

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:42.500
He had Colvin I was like

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.385
