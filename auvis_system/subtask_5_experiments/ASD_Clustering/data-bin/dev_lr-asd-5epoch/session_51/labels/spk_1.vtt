WEBVTT

00:00:15.545 --> 00:00:19.779
Orchestra. Orchestra.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.356
Yeah, I feel like...

00:00:31.356 --> 00:00:35.525
When I do like orchestra, like summer camp, that's when I feel like it's fun.

00:00:35.525 --> 00:00:39.067
Yes, you know, but then like for his bill or like school stuff

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:43.033
(***)

00:00:45.463 --> 00:00:49.632
Yeah, like it feels better. ha ha ha

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:58.981
it gives me little more (***) You and I

00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:02.304
like even better. Yeah

00:01:02.304 --> 00:01:06.472
(***) here (***)

00:01:06.472 --> 00:01:11.468
But there are also people that are so (***) that could be better

00:01:11.918 --> 00:01:15.525
(***) i feel like (***)

00:01:15.872 --> 00:01:20.057
(***)

00:01:20.057 --> 00:01:23.955
Orchestra rehearsal would go much smoother if everyone could play their part.

00:01:23.955 --> 00:01:27.465
yeah yeah

00:01:27.465 --> 00:01:31.684
Is there any orchestra around that you want to play?

00:01:31.684 --> 00:01:35.785
ha ha ha

00:01:57.604 --> 00:02:00.693
Yeah, me too.

00:02:09.603 --> 00:02:10.631
But don't stay up.

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:19.728
Oh, the stingray.

00:02:21.128 --> 00:02:22.664
Yeah

00:02:30.528 --> 00:02:34.999
ha ha ha (***)

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:39.589
Yeah

00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:50.980
oh Definitely, definitely.

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.950
ah I feel like

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.945
I definitely agree with that. I feel like orchestra is much more fun when we're actually

00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:05.576
doing like yeah

00:03:07.095 --> 00:03:11.803
Yeah, but I don't think, I don't think orchestra is usually that good.

00:03:11.803 --> 00:03:16.629
Last year we had a contemporary concert where we like

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.447
(***) so many

00:03:19.447 --> 00:03:22.654
Yeah, it was so bad.

00:03:25.557 --> 00:03:28.915
yeah its like uhhhh ahhhh

00:03:28.915 --> 00:03:31.683
uhffff ahh ahhh

00:03:32.492 --> 00:03:36.457
I was so like no yeah

00:03:36.457 --> 00:03:39.681
Like I really don't like it when they like 

00:03:39.681 --> 00:03:43.714
When you can well you can obviously tell if they

00:03:43.714 --> 00:03:46.516
Play your instrument or not

00:03:46.516 --> 00:03:51.392
They asked for like ridiculous yeah

00:03:51.392 --> 00:03:55.965
Yeah, but if it's like going into it, I like Brahms Symphony.

00:03:55.965 --> 00:04:00.707
And then like talking to (***)

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.193

00:04:12.486 --> 00:04:14.562
We should.

00:04:16.561 --> 00:04:19.559
yeah

00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:29.648
No, it's because of Frankie.

00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:46.877
I feel like last year Jake was a little more...

00:04:46.877 --> 00:04:51.501
like  even with the tardy 

00:04:51.501 --> 00:04:56.394
 Yeah, some one  like a (***) I think that's just like

00:04:56.394 --> 00:05:01.355
Last year, I think Kayla's friend or something showed up a couple minutes later.

00:05:01.355 --> 00:05:06.350
Like once or twice and her her grade dropped like a whole like

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.929
She grew up on regular A, 

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:14.924
Even knows like everyone's name

00:05:14.924 --> 00:05:17.437
(***)

00:05:17.437 --> 00:05:21.302
I feel like she doesn't know.

00:05:22.838 --> 00:05:27.833
really wow yeah yeah so i think it's the person 

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:28.103

00:06:05.853 --> 00:06:10.848
like, is he okay? And then I just had to tell him. I was like, Pagosian.

00:06:10.848 --> 00:06:15.843
