WEBVTT

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.784
Orchestra, orchestra, orchestra, yeah

00:00:20.088 --> 00:00:22.062
He is like (***)

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.166
No, I don't like the class, but I just like orchestra in general. ha ha ha

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.614

00:00:35.614 --> 00:00:38.971

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:42.700
And now because they

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.852
You're inspired. You know, that's what I think.

00:00:50.852 --> 00:00:54.023
general term yeah

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:02.224

00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:05.162

00:01:24.378 --> 00:01:26.925
Yeah yeah

00:01:32.954 --> 00:01:35.790
Too much. Too much.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.722
but yeah i feel like without i think yeah without orchestra i don't think

00:01:39.722 --> 00:01:44.177
because like there was like in middle school like i was with a teacher who like

00:01:44.177 --> 00:01:46.690
Didn't correct my bad habits

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.349
So like, because I switched to another teacher and she was like, oh, you're playing all this wrong.

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:54.385
Like I like during that period of time I wanted to

00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:59.329
(***) yeah like orchestra was only (***)

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.094
yeah

00:02:09.118 --> 00:02:11.632
Yeah Yes.

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:15.766
Yeah, we have plasmid.

00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:19.496
California will stay.

00:02:19.496 --> 00:02:22.348
They were really fun!

00:02:22.348 --> 00:02:25.283
Yeah, the rap was fine, and then like...

00:02:25.283 --> 00:02:27.799
The people there, I mean...

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.532
Some of them are kind of toxic, but that's just from my...

00:02:30.532 --> 00:02:34.902
area because like the bay, like those kids, they are just like that.

00:02:34.902 --> 00:02:39.104
yeah (***) yeah

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:57.043
(***) hu huhhh

00:02:57.043 --> 00:02:57.211
you

00:03:03.404 --> 00:03:06.763
Some of the chamber stuff is cool. I don't know.

00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:09.716
someone have chambers

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.217
(***) Orchestra usual

00:03:16.178 --> 00:03:20.009
Oh, yeah, yes

00:03:22.624 --> 00:03:25.493
It was like different to like breathing in the music.

00:03:25.493 --> 00:03:28.920
it was like one was like fogging up the mirror

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.433
And one was like...

00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:35.197
ha ha ha

00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:47.481
ahh

00:03:47.785 --> 00:03:52.680
Ridiculous stuff. Yeah yeah

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:58.973
oh yeah

00:03:58.973 --> 00:04:01.489
None of the teachers really like Stolber.

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.981
because we are not playing like the rap that like our excerpts are.

00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:07.918
We don't play in context. Yeah

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.064
We don't want to play like Mozart, really. Yeah, like symphony

00:04:13.064 --> 00:04:14.076
Yeah.

00:04:24.354 --> 00:04:29.314
It's cuz of Frankie It's just Frankie

00:04:35.997 --> 00:04:39.019
ah   ah

00:04:46.915 --> 00:04:49.598
strike yeah

00:04:52.972 --> 00:04:55.672
It just depends on the person.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.899
Oh really? Okay, yeah, so it's just the person.

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:13.223
Frankie's like, oh, I'm a spreadsheet.

00:05:15.096 --> 00:05:17.932
That's true

00:05:17.932 --> 00:05:22.860
You're right, because when I had COVID and with the mask, Jacob, like, recognized me.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.002
 Yeah yeah.

00:05:37.456 --> 00:05:39.026
