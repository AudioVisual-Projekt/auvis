00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:18.850
I feel like the hardest part is like...

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.939
Religion? No..

00:03:24.456 --> 00:03:27.057

***

00:03:57.056 --> 00:04:02.051
Yeah, you can guess. So you don't even move it. Because they're like hard to read.

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:12.783
Do you memorize all the gestures? Oh.

00:04:12.917 --> 00:04:14.571

But she's our worst teacher

00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:32.762
I feel like I hated her when I was 

00:04:33.338 --> 00:04:34.982
I hated her

00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:41.640

Oh yeah. Do you know

00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:51.646
Has she ever made you like your entire test like that?

00:04:51.646 --> 00:04:54.195
One choice, one answer choice.

00:04:55.941 --> 00:05:00.674
Like, for caustic, she made, she made one test all to that.

00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:07.457
She made one one test all D, so it was multiple choice all D.

00:05:07.457 --> 00:05:12.452
And then just has reversed that, no, right

00:05:12.452 --> 00:05:12.503

00:05:20.334 --> 00:05:23.320
Okay, but like

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.931
I don't know. Because Carlson found out people were cheating.

00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:31.370
I think she did that as a curveball.

00:05:32.752 --> 00:05:36.689
Huh. So maybe Hernandez which is possible

00:05:36.574 --> 00:05:40.549
