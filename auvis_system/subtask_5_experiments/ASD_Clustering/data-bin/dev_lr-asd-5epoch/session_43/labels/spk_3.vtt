WEBVTT

00:00:47.018 --> 00:00:48.493
Um....

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.854
So, wait, where were we?

00:00:55.213 --> 00:01:00.208
Oh my gosh, wait. Fontaine's of Audubon.

00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:01.202
Not am

00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:19.900
That's the thing, like now it's less about...

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.440
Like it's, if we came in the more like have I'm it's more like crying

00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:30.735
Now even more than ever.

00:01:36.587 --> 00:01:37.759
yeah

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:44.336
I remember like before because like it was easy to follow.

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:49.331
Or maybe like instead of having banners like that, I feel like it's better like

00:01:49.973 --> 00:01:53.027
Each person gets their own individual banner or something?

00:01:53.027 --> 00:01:57.751
But that, that generates less money. That Generates less money, if you do that

00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:00.598
So like my idea was like when you start the quest.

00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:04.249
You get all the you get the banners for the characters in that nation

00:02:04.174 --> 00:02:08.602
But I don't know how that works, like maybe you speak through the glass in like two days, you know what I mean?

00:02:08.602 --> 00:02:13.774
But maybe like, maybe it's unlockable, like you said, like the level requirement instead of doing level requirements.

00:02:13.736 --> 00:02:15.352
It is like you have to complete

00:02:15.352 --> 00:02:20.346
At least the first part ah you have to complete the last Archon, Archon's storyline.

00:02:20.346 --> 00:02:24.172
In orders to unlock the characters for the next nation

00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:42.437
No, but then the Mexican, they didn't have enough money though, the point of *** banners is

00:02:42.437 --> 00:02:43.500
Generate the ***

00:02:46.688 --> 00:02:49.727
No, they spent more money when it started. It was everyone's

00:02:49.727 --> 00:02:54.856
pull together and everyone's there at the same time, then you can take your time to be free to play and just keep grinding, right?

00:02:54.705 --> 00:02:58.687
but if they give you a time limit, the more and more we'll spend money.

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.187
Serious

00:03:01.808 --> 00:03:04.880
No, but what?Maybe what if it's like

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.394
no, but and like

00:03:07.394 --> 00:03:11.985
If you got this standard banner, you get a character that's like 25 each words

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:20.214
I don't regret it.

00:03:24.523 --> 00:03:25.906
I love my ***

00:03:30.598 --> 00:03:35.776
I only remember our like 300, like 1,300 day Ayaka banner.

00:03:35.701 --> 00:03:37.887
They're like 300 day Ayaka banner

00:03:42.207 --> 00:03:45.987
I am, yeah, I am. Yeah, 300. It goes like that.

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:58.128
No, no, no. It was like the mentor number on the banner side like a really

00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:01.124
long time but it didn't actually last that long.

00:04:02.694 --> 00:04:06.726
It didn't no, it didn't actually last that long. It was just the number was really high.

00:04:06.726 --> 00:04:09.866
And then they lowered it once they were ready to end the bet.

00:04:14.675 --> 00:04:16.397
***I don't know.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.565
oh...

00:04:22.994 --> 00:04:25.322
I'm not sure about that one, I don't know.

00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:37.855
I'm not a fan of turn-based combat. I like- I like gunship because I can just butt bash.

00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:41.774
And it works. I like Genshin because I can button match and it works.

00:04:42.266 --> 00:04:47.209
No, I I I have the keyword, right? So I just spam my skill because I have Navi on.

00:04:47.852 --> 00:04:52.020
So Navia is basically her the way she works, her elemental side.

00:04:51.907 --> 00:04:54.196
and all of her stuff is based off of attack.

00:04:54.196 --> 00:04:56.711
And then you...

00:04:56.975 --> 00:05:01.599
When you get like crystallized shields, the more shields you have. I think it's up to 6.

00:05:02.015 --> 00:05:05.586
Um..The more shields you have, the more damage you do with your skill.

00:05:06.192 --> 00:05:10.006
so it increases the base value and because the base value is increased if you do

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.180
***Just on the skill

00:05:20.792 --> 00:05:24.790
Oh, she sells herself out to power creep. It's like over.

00:05:29.042 --> 00:05:30.848
PPPPPPP

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:37.271
no...

00:05:41.817 --> 00:05:45.413
Wow that's so like really good. I just need to do

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.441
That's such an early tension like simcard

00:05:50.932 --> 00:05:52.349
That's

00:05:58.428 --> 00:05:59.903
ohhh!

00:06:00.718 --> 00:06:03.586
I didn't. I didn't do

00:06:03.586 --> 00:06:08.345
Cuz I didn't pray to her***And then I had CCIMCbecause she was a good healer

00:06:08.345 --> 00:06:09.881
and I likes healing

00:06:10.742 --> 00:06:13.997
CC I have a really like she's not like

00:06:13.997 --> 00:06:19.568
Oh she's in her 20k care, but like you know how like when you use her skin

00:06:19.492 --> 00:06:23.751
 When you like hit there's when you're like attacking something which is a acting

00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:28.747
It feels like paradise. Like each one of those feels like a thousand miles.

00:06:37.792 --> 00:06:41.859
Ohh....I ***

00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:44.795
like I want 56, 60 but on side
