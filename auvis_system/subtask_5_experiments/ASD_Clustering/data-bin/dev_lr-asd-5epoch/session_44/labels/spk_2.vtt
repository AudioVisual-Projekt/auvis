WEBVTT

00:00:34.754 --> 00:00:37.183
So where were we?

00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:41.653
Characters, characters. yeah, yeah, yeah

00:00:42.696 --> 00:00:44.159
aahm

00:00:47.427 --> 00:00:51.157
Maybe like one, four stars. I'm a free-to-play person.

00:00:54.143 --> 00:00:58.243
We are.. huh?

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:01.888
No, the only skin I have...

00:01:01.888 --> 00:01:07.423
It's like, anytime I have skins in any games, it's because my friend pays for it.

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:14.932
we all have the free ones but if i have like a bad skin it's probably because of a birthday gift or something

00:01:18.949 --> 00:01:23.117
Ah The first one I got was the birthday one.

00:01:24.907 --> 00:01:30.518
No, no, no. no, the Barbara, the skin, the costume. um, From the Archipelago.

00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:39.453
I only rolled a weapon banner for Xiao's weapon and I got it in 30 so it was okay.

00:01:39.453 --> 00:01:40.938
See ya.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.961
Yeah, so basically on his first rerun, um, I

00:01:47.655 --> 00:01:50.635
Roll for him? I had like a lot saved up.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.242
I was like I had like 10, 11k saved up for him and I got him and

00:01:55.127 --> 00:01:59.533
30 pulls and I had a lot of extra so I just went for his weapon and I got it, I got it.

00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:03.198
so i was so lucky it was the most insane

00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:05.979
Blank balls I've ever gotten ever.

00:02:08.342 --> 00:02:12.004
We had the best ones ever, like, it was really cool.

00:02:17.083 --> 00:02:19.125
I can't hear you.

00:02:22.973 --> 00:02:26.720
Oh, I want to see one for her first Constellation.

00:02:32.876 --> 00:02:34.339
ahw..

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:36.966
ohh...!

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:44.183
Yeah, no, I know what you mean. It's her, It's because like during her skill like you kind of like dash forward.

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:47.171
So there's no charge oh well, that's so good

00:02:58.754 --> 00:02:59.832
oh

00:03:00.105 --> 00:03:01.645
ohhh..

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:17.831
Ohh...okay, I see, I see. Wait, how do you feel like what's your favorite character?

00:03:17.754 --> 00:03:22.153
From Monsta then. from Monsta

00:03:22.153 --> 00:03:25.057
Or for each nation each nation.

00:03:26.781 --> 00:03:30.457
Um, Design, play style, lore.

00:03:39.468 --> 00:03:43.433
Well yeah, I have gone you though so like anchor

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.711
And then they they got like rejected. They got sent back. 

00:03:57.153 --> 00:04:01.473
No, literally like the developers were the developers were like

00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:03.987
There's going to be people trying to get across the ocean.

00:04:04.564 --> 00:04:08.981
They know, huhuhuhu

00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:13.976
at least like cut them off halfway before letting them spend like five hours of their lives

00:04:16.929 --> 00:04:20.244
They really they did it for hours and like you can

00:04:20.206 --> 00:04:23.583
even like an AFK for it because you just have to keep going forward.

00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:31.327
they really...

00:04:33.372 --> 00:04:35.490
it's, huh?

00:04:37.788 --> 00:04:41.212
Ohhh..... what's that?

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:42.741
um....

00:04:44.088 --> 00:04:45.584
I'm gonna

00:04:45.584 --> 00:04:51.272
To be honest, I did not like Bunty at first. I didn't like Bunty at first.

00:04:51.156 --> 00:04:54.051
Like I thought he was annoying.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.109
Venti.

00:04:58.258 --> 00:05:02.171
Um...I do really like...

00:05:07.065 --> 00:05:10.846
Yeah, like Kaya for the ice cream. Or like...

00:05:10.846 --> 00:05:14.719
I do not like to lose.

00:05:17.377 --> 00:05:21.798
You know like his outfit is so much better because it fixes like 

00:05:21.798 --> 00:05:24.851
the wrong things about whatever is going on with him.

00:05:24.774 --> 00:05:28.666
But like his regular default, he just has like a really really big forehead.

00:05:28.666 --> 00:05:31.382
He has a really scrunched up face.

00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:36.007
Yeah, it's been a while. Like a long time, like years.

00:05:36.007 --> 00:05:38.976
It's like the first five-star costume to come out.

00:05:38.976 --> 00:05:44.318
No, it's like no like there's five, there's there's five stars you have costumes

00:05:44.203 --> 00:05:49.775
But then the costume itself is like a purple well the costume itself for dealing is

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.847
because it changes um, it's a gold one when it changes

00:05:52.732 --> 00:05:56.121
It's your skill and your elemental powers.

00:05:59.902 --> 00:06:04.188
Yeah, first, it actually changes the color of his fire basically.

00:06:07.462 --> 00:06:13.034
I don't think so. It's gonna take a while. There's only like two so far. I forgot the other one.

00:06:14.228 --> 00:06:17.852
Um, Yeah, probably not.

00:06:18.674 --> 00:06:19.872
I...

00:06:22.344 --> 00:06:27.840
I got this serious um, I felt like it's moving too much towards like

00:06:27.725 --> 00:06:30.956
Like a modern feeling? Cause the purpose of it?

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:34.613
at the beginning was more like fantasy, right? And then now like...
