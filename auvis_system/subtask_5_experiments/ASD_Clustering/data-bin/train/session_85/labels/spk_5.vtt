WEBVTT

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:23.096
Um...

00:00:23.647 --> 00:00:25.631
Okay. And

00:00:26.768 --> 00:00:29.208
Um so the official is

00:00:29.553 --> 00:00:32.718
13. 13. But...

00:00:33.786 --> 00:00:37.714
And last year, or two summers ago, there was a 12 year old.

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:41.073
Yeah. Yeah. But she was

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:44.377
like very, very primary style

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.180
Even if they're 13, they're like, really worried.

00:00:50.094 --> 00:00:53.778
Yeah, yeah. Them. Yeah.

00:01:02.568 --> 00:01:05.606
Nope. No, not at all. Summer weather.

00:01:07.714 --> 00:01:08.954
So, so, so.

00:01:10.457 --> 00:01:13.623
No. Oh, wait, wait. I have a winter coat too. Sorry.

00:01:13.968 --> 00:01:18.619
You should move fast. Sorry, uh summer night

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.328
uh really the people the people the connections.

00:01:23.328 --> 00:01:27.495
um but also the chamber music.

00:01:27.495 --> 00:01:32.034
um like the string quartets doing that.

00:01:32.034 --> 00:01:34.161
The person who creates the groups.

00:01:35.248 --> 00:01:38.447
is kind of a magician. She knows exactly who to group.

00:01:38.447 --> 00:01:41.400
And who will work really well with their each other

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.691
Also considering the sound they make as a group with their instruments.

00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:47.433
She knows. She somehow knows.

00:01:49.334 --> 00:01:51.108
Yeah, and she also...

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:54.589
Just understands what kind of person you are.

00:01:55.278 --> 00:01:58.963
Oh, and she's very experienced too. Yes.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.438
A lot of the... There's just like so many perfect

00:02:03.507 --> 00:02:06.528
components of the camp that just makes it like a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.523
Also the place it's in front of the beach it's on an island.

00:02:13.952 --> 00:02:18.796
Yeah. Yeah. So that one is also PMP.

00:02:18.796 --> 00:02:21.714
They do a winter residency um

00:02:21.887 --> 00:02:25.796
in Sarasota, Florida. Sarasota, Florida.

00:02:33.123 --> 00:02:36.547
Oh, oh. yeah okay so that's more in the summer when it's hot.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.787
and then we perform the one

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:43.509
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:44.336 --> 00:02:48.159
Yeah, it's like humid, very humid, um so like

00:02:48.904 --> 00:02:49.696
Hmm?

00:02:51.144 --> 00:02:55.819
Yeah, um, not too much, not too much. Boston was much more driven.

00:02:56.232 --> 00:02:59.512
But, but Long Island, um...

00:03:00.164 --> 00:03:01.198
There is

00:03:01.152 --> 00:03:05.572
the one thing about PMP that I want them to change is that

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:09.048
The performance space is like in a

00:03:09.048 --> 00:03:11.642
tent or a really big like

00:03:12.124 --> 00:03:16.642
Outdoor tent, like, you know, construct, constructed tent like.

00:03:16.815 --> 00:03:21.534
but it's like basically outdoors so the instrument it gets super like wet

00:03:21.948 --> 00:03:25.972
and like from the humidity and so like your fingers are like

00:03:27.763 --> 00:03:28.844
Yeah, true.

00:03:29.154 --> 00:03:32.857
so it's like the saying is like if you can play in the tent you can play anywhere

00:03:33.925 --> 00:03:37.722
Cause it's a horrible place to perform. Yeah.

00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:40.021
But, it's good.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:48.199
Florida is also a town, the performance is. But, Florida's kind of...

00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:50.255
Not as humid as I thought.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.616
But I think in winter it's a little better

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.089
it's not bad. Yeah, it was actually cold sometimes.

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.495
But like New Year's Day we all like went to wherever we wanted

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:09.479
Not, wherever. They gave us options like amusement park, whatever, and whenever.

00:04:09.754 --> 00:04:13.387
So I'm but I went to like the beach in the town just to like rest

00:04:14.214 --> 00:04:17.133
But it was like sunny, it's hot.

00:04:17.822 --> 00:04:20.414
The waves were really nice. It was like summer, midsummer.

00:04:20.414 --> 00:04:24.064
Yeah. Yeah. So there....

00:04:24.202 --> 00:04:26.433
Kick off. yeah recently

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.159
This year? Okay, uh May.

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:37.137
I went to New York City to perform as a string quartet.

00:04:38.308 --> 00:04:41.592
Man, this place is awesome.

00:04:41.592 --> 00:04:44.156
So, so, so, so, now turn around. Yeah.

00:04:47.693 --> 00:04:51.673
That was fun, that was fun. It kind of really, it happened super quickly

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.451
Yeah, also cuz we were

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.732
Sorry?

00:04:58.044 --> 00:04:59.084
Yeah. Ah.

00:05:00.931 --> 00:05:04.272
I think we did. We did.

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:08.451
Yeah, I love museums, yeah. just

00:05:08.968 --> 00:05:13.233
We went to like pretty like specific museums like

00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:15.090
would like specific exhibits.

00:05:15.917 --> 00:05:18.775
We did, we went to like an architect show.

00:05:20.534 --> 00:05:24.488
Someone who you know, their exhibit, that was cool

00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:31.085
Yeah. It's fun. It's

00:05:31.258 --> 00:05:34.808
sometimes a little overstimulating with all the lights and the people

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.283
But also, no one really cares.

00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:42.764
About like other people so like you're really like as much

00:05:42.764 --> 00:05:46.308
It's like a little ironic but like there's so many people but

00:05:46.308 --> 00:05:49.952
You can feel like pretty like centered and alone.

00:05:49.952 --> 00:05:53.260
But you're, you also don't feel lonely because there's so many people.

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:58.255
Also. And.... PMP is

00:05:58.668 --> 00:06:03.146
The camp is basically a branch of like Juilliard.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.008
So like the faculty are all from Juilliard, the staff are basically all from Juilliard.

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:11.433
And so there's also a lot of Juilliard students.

00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:14.320
pre-college students. So

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:18.372
Whenever I go to New York City, I make sure to go visit all my PMP friends.
