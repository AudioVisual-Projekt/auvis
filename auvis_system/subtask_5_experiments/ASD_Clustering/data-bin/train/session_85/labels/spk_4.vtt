WEBVTT

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:12.231
OK.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.220
So, we're talking about the three portions. There's the beets,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.691
the green one and the black one.

00:00:28.804 --> 00:00:29.831
Oh, okay.

00:00:37.407 --> 00:00:38.371
Yeah.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.963
It's like...

00:00:55.786 --> 00:00:56.520
mmh

00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:07.093
Oh my god. That's so funny. um

00:01:07.794 --> 00:01:09.542
Did you ever see the office?

00:01:10.276 --> 00:01:13.013
No, okay, there is a character that really has a beet

00:01:13.013 --> 00:01:17.656
farm. It's hysterical. That's it. I just reminded you guys. Yes.

00:01:26.682 --> 00:01:27.547
Right.

00:01:35.983 --> 00:01:37.908
So, do you remember what it was?

00:01:40.613 --> 00:01:41.348
mmh

00:02:01.025 --> 00:02:03.287
It's like everything's an acquired taste.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.400
Yeah. It's like everything's an acquired taste, huh?

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:18.424
Larissa? Yes.

00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:21.780
Um that's so interesting, so

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.556
um I know like when, I had taken Russian for two years.

00:02:26.556 --> 00:02:29.069
And I saw my name for the first time.

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.411
because nobody ever has Larissa, like on the keychains.

00:02:32.411 --> 00:02:35.633
You know little souvenirs and places.

00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:39.903
And so when I saw it in the Russian book, I was like...

00:02:39.903 --> 00:02:41.005
My name!

00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:46.849
Yes. But I didn't care. It was my name.

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:52.579
Um so I, my mom thought I was gonna be a boy.

00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:55.951
And she already knew that she was gonna name me after my dad.

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.867
And so when I was born, the doctor's like...

00:03:00.502 --> 00:03:03.224
Oh, it was a girl. And she was like

00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:08.520
Woah, I don't have a name, so she just looked through her baby book real quick and picked my name

00:03:10.902 --> 00:03:15.188
Yeah, so that was before the sonograms like where they said,

00:03:15.188 --> 00:03:18.122
boy, girl, you just have to wait for the surprise.

00:03:21.073 --> 00:03:23.980
Yeah, she knew it was a boy. She knew it was a boy.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.790
And she has prayed that. She's like, God, she wasn't

00:03:29.224 --> 00:03:33.022
necessarily like, she was, she didn't have a relationship

00:03:33.022 --> 00:03:35.370
of God, like a personal relationship with Jesus.

00:03:35.236 --> 00:03:39.692
She was like, God, I want this kid to look exactly like the father.

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:44.400
And uh, so she just in her head knew that it was going to be a boy. And

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.281
Tada! But everybody thinks I look just like my dad, so

00:03:48.781 --> 00:03:51.598
I was like, I was like you played too hard, mom.

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:54.998
So, yeah.

00:03:55.064 --> 00:03:57.938
But um I'm from Tucson, Arizona.

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:01.223
And uh I always

00:04:01.223 --> 00:04:04.598
We would come to Disneyland every year.

00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:08.281
and then sometimes we might go to Universal or whatever for vacations.

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:13.173
And I always loved LA and everybody in Tucson at that time.

00:04:13.373 --> 00:04:15.889
even now they think Los Angeles is like

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.160
Orange County, like it's just one. Disney Land's in L.A.

00:04:21.163 --> 00:04:22.234
So, what...

00:04:27.362 --> 00:04:31.226
yeah or you can go straight like up the 10 like going through

00:04:31.192 --> 00:04:36.270
Phoenix and taking on the 10 through Coachella. And you just take the 10 all the way along.

00:04:36.771 --> 00:04:39.212
That's the way I do it too. And

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:43.024
So everybody thinks it's in LA, but I also feel like...

00:04:43.024 --> 00:04:46.634
L.A. since I was little. I was always fascinated with

00:04:46.634 --> 00:04:49.216
like the big city life and

00:04:49.216 --> 00:04:53.483
you know just all these people and of course there's big Disneyland's there that's why San Diego

00:04:53.483 --> 00:04:57.672
we're never interested there. And so when I was...

00:04:57.738 --> 00:05:01.855
When was it? I was praying about coming over here.

00:05:01.855 --> 00:05:06.716
And I actually quit my career so I could work with survivors of trafficking.

00:05:06.716 --> 00:05:11.711
in L.A. work with survivors in trafficking. And so

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:16.098
That's when I came the first time in like 2013. And then because

00:05:16.098 --> 00:05:19.572
I didn't know how to fundraise at the time or any of that.

00:05:19.605 --> 00:05:22.764
Stuff like my funding ran out within five months, so I had to

00:05:22.764 --> 00:05:24.978
go back home. And

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:30.172
I ended up working there for a little bit and when I came back I had an opportunity

00:05:30.172 --> 00:05:33.985
I jumped on it and so I've been living here in South LA.

00:05:33.985 --> 00:05:36.668
for seven years. Um

00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:41.078
I... the first time I was in Echo Park, so it was very different.

00:05:44.568 --> 00:05:47.074
After five months, so it's like 2014

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.468
when I went back to Arizona, and then 2017 I went back.

00:05:53.472 --> 00:05:57.165
Yeah, I was dying for a way to come back and so...

00:05:58.601 --> 00:06:03.129
I called up some friends and I'm like I need to go back to LA like some friends that

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:05.644
I worked with at that um organization.

00:06:05.644 --> 00:06:09.711
And they're like, I don't have nothing here but you can try.

00:06:09.877 --> 00:06:13.792
this friend because she's looking for somebody to like be like an 

00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:18.400
intake coordinator, whatever. So I called her and I ended up getting the job. And I was...
