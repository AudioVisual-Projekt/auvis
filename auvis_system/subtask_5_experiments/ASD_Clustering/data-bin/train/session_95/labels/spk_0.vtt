WEBVTT

00:00:21.415 --> 00:00:22.867
Okay.

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:29.645
I have so many

00:00:29.668 --> 00:00:34.561
So I really like listening to music and I like going to concerts.

00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:38.931
I'm going to just say all of them. We can talk about it.

00:00:38.977 --> 00:00:42.487
Whichever way you want to. I love to bullet journal.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:47.183
Have you heard of that? It's so fun.

00:00:47.183 --> 00:00:49.698
And I like to watch (***)

00:00:49.698 --> 00:00:54.693
I like to hang out with my friends and I love to go to different cafes.

00:00:54.693 --> 00:00:57.207
 we try to cut much...

00:00:57.207 --> 00:01:01.545
and then i like to go eat different

00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:06.016
Which guy do you think? I'm gonna start buying like masks around Kingidoa. (***)

00:01:06.016 --> 00:01:08.952
Oh and I like going there. Yeah.

00:01:12.918 --> 00:01:15.972
The last time you went (***)

00:01:19.836 --> 00:01:24.511
10 years ago,Yeah... he changed  the lot.

00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:29.118
Yes. (***)

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:35.987
Yes....   Yes...

00:01:35.987 --> 00:01:40.981
I know like right now they have a deal where you can...

00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:45.335
It's like $200 but it's for 3 days.

00:01:45.335 --> 00:01:50.330
So you can choose one park and that's it to go to?

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.925
And then your guy I think so..

00:01:56.675 --> 00:01:59.764
Yes..... yes... yeah...

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:05.264
That's it.

00:02:05.264 --> 00:02:10.225
That's what it is. So I thought because they used to do it before.

00:02:10.225 --> 00:02:12.824
is they yeah you have to go like

00:02:12.824 --> 00:02:16.892
They will be protected through Friday. Yeah, or was it Monday through?

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.380
You couldn't go on the weekend. They changed that.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.401
even (***) weekend we got...

00:02:24.401 --> 00:02:26.881
I was really surprised. so

00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:29.717
Hmm...

00:02:29.902 --> 00:02:31.430
Yeah...

00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:36.511
It would be fun to choose three. (***)

00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:39.284
Different day (***)  fine

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:43.622
and then maybe you could go to like Disney one day and then but then time to go to school

00:02:43.622 --> 00:02:46.895
But the California entered...

00:02:48.093 --> 00:02:52.599
You can't do both in one day, but you can choose one.

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.315
Two tickets free... tickets free...

00:02:55.315 --> 00:02:58.168
and it's like you can use it

00:02:58.168 --> 00:03:01.222
You can choose a date from now until the middle of May.

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:05.897
so you don't have to go like all 30 days in a row, you can go like throughout the month

00:03:05.897 --> 00:03:08.950
Yeah...

00:03:13.034 --> 00:03:14.873
Haunted Mansion.

00:03:18.317 --> 00:03:22.586
I think the more classic one would be better. (***)

00:03:22.586 --> 00:03:26.467
I love Alex in Wonderland. I love

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.329
Peter Pan.

00:03:29.086 --> 00:03:29.928
And...

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.896
(***)

00:03:40.743 --> 00:03:44.895
And I like pirates. What do you like when you went?

00:03:46.801 --> 00:03:51.341
Oh, you wanted to go on it a lot.

00:03:58.343 --> 00:03:59.782
Ahhh...

00:04:01.528 --> 00:04:02.502
Ahh...

00:04:06.782 --> 00:04:11.760
Maybe because they're really high quality.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.898
So that's why they had that.

00:04:15.765 --> 00:04:20.304
I wonder who they were from. But I think you would just love it.

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:25.343
And if you want to go, let me know. I'll go with you.

00:04:25.343 --> 00:04:28.111
I'll meet you there, yes.

00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:32.162
and I want to (***)

00:04:32.117 --> 00:04:36.622
Last year and this year were the first years that I didn't have a

00:04:36.666 --> 00:04:38.878
 to the past

00:04:39.452 --> 00:04:43.856
Or if you want to know where something's at, I could take you there quickly.

00:04:43.856 --> 00:04:46.438
Yes,   Ha... ha... ha...

00:04:46.438 --> 00:04:51.010
I will be your guide.

00:04:57.929 --> 00:05:00.512
I definitely want to go.

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:04.871
For sure, I would love to have enough money to go to all the Disney parks.

00:05:08.037 --> 00:05:12.020
Ummm... Well, I've gone to the one in Florida.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.361
because my brother worked there so we got him for free.

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:20.148
yeah that's the only reason why we were able to... And then I have...

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:25.402
There when I was in Paris years ago, they had just opened.

00:05:25.402 --> 00:05:28.287
and they said you either go to the Louvre

00:05:28.287 --> 00:05:30.801
Museum or you go to Disneyland.

00:05:30.801 --> 00:05:35.510
So I choose the museum.... Yeah..

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.863
I would like to go back there again when we went to Shanghai.

00:05:39.863 --> 00:05:43.037
They open the park the next year so I didn't get to come.

00:05:43.037 --> 00:05:45.568
So I'll have to vote back.

00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:48.801
They had to like, I can Hong Kong tour...

00:05:48.757 --> 00:05:53.347
So I what about to the one in Japan, in Tokyo?

00:05:53.347 --> 00:05:55.642
Then I got to go to the one in Paris.

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:00.991
and what about the one in Shanghai and Hong Kong so I got like more parts too

00:06:04.755 --> 00:06:07.421
Yeah... yeah... yeah...

00:06:07.421 --> 00:06:11.774
Yeah, I got win the lottery so I can get all the money.
