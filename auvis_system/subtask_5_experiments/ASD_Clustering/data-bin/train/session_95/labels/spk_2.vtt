WEBVTT

00:00:22.043 --> 00:00:22.938
Okay.

00:00:24.654 --> 00:00:26.109
Yeah...

00:00:26.847 --> 00:00:27.691
Yeah.

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:37.546
No... Like other ones they use like all sorts of different methods

00:00:37.546 --> 00:00:40.768
But then some of those messege brought other kaiju in.

00:00:47.703 --> 00:00:51.316
No, I don't think so that seemed like a pretty like

00:00:51.316 --> 00:00:52.885
Original, original.

00:01:03.702 --> 00:01:06.706
Preferably either Master  or King Ghidorah.

00:01:07.982 --> 00:01:09.018
Yeah...

00:01:11.548 --> 00:01:12.916
The main ones.

00:01:14.484 --> 00:01:19.480
I don't know, maybe, but I think the master or the king will have to come out first.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.652
First where's the metro going to?

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.750
Yeah...

00:01:34.414 --> 00:01:38.363
Probably, but I don't know, I am U S .. (***)I'm kind of sore ass looking.

00:01:38.363 --> 00:01:41.670
You know the one, the spiky one?

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.746
Yeah, the one that like, not very strong.

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:50.645
Yeah...

00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:53.786
i think i was might have been the first one but i'm not so sure

00:01:57.753 --> 00:02:00.301
I think, yeah.

00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:05.295
Mothra also came out, but Mothra got a little something, yeah?

00:02:10.388 --> 00:02:11.777
Yeah...

00:02:14.493 --> 00:02:16.764
Yeah...   Yeah...

00:02:24.145 --> 00:02:25.997
Yeah...

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:27.889
Yeah...

00:02:35.772 --> 00:02:38.320
I don't know

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.280
It's not the Mako Godzilla because it's too old for that kind of thing.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.146
Yeah, but then the King Ghidorah might have come out

00:02:54.318 --> 00:02:57.794
I want the three-necked, but there's only three necks in that one.

00:03:02.754 --> 00:03:04.577
Yeah, everything milo...

00:03:09.758 --> 00:03:12.796
yeah yeah yeah

00:03:14.317 --> 00:03:15.706
Yeah...

00:03:16.743 --> 00:03:20.659
I guess.. but like, I think like the more like...

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.431
a classic one might be better.

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:23.973
Yeah...

00:03:28.735 --> 00:03:29.926
Yeah...

00:03:30.683 --> 00:03:33.315
Huh, then Minia.

00:03:33.315 --> 00:03:38.310
I'm not sure because that one is like more like a less of an atomic monster

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.225
This one's like created by atomic bomb, right? Mostly.

00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:46.899
But then if a smaller one came out, they would think, where did that come from?

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.298
They didn't have many weapons back then, but I like the tanks.

00:04:06.607 --> 00:04:08.900
Yeah...

00:04:10.453 --> 00:04:11.710
Yeah...

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.943
Yeah...

00:04:14.135 --> 00:04:18.777
That's why they didn't have them. But then the government also didn't help them in that.

00:04:20.902 --> 00:04:22.181
Yeah...

00:04:25.858 --> 00:04:27.446
Yeah...

00:04:28.108 --> 00:04:33.104
I mean, but the weapons, I think like that America took away the weapons or something.

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.662
Because all those ships didn't have the cannons.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.635
But if that was so, then why did they have tanks and why did they even have that big warship?

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:40.714
and we'll see you soon.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.592
Yeah, yeah, but anyway, but that ship other price

00:04:55.548 --> 00:04:58.719
Wasn't really strong enough to defeat

00:05:01.707 --> 00:05:03.815
Yeah...

00:05:06.549 --> 00:05:11.375
Yeah, they just like stepped on all of them. Yeah.

00:05:11.858 --> 00:05:13.181
Yeah...

00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:19.801
Yeah...

00:05:20.103 --> 00:05:22.198
Yeah...

00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:26.637
Yeah...

00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:31.299
Yeah...

00:05:35.777 --> 00:05:40.418
Well, playing was to distract it or something, or like...

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:45.548
I think so, but then the Godzilla came on land, so...

00:05:45.548 --> 00:05:48.787
They had to lure it back to the ocean.

00:05:50.796 --> 00:05:52.582
Yeah...

00:05:56.803 --> 00:05:59.791
Oh, it did, it did. I remember they were shooting it.

00:06:04.025 --> 00:06:08.818
yeah yeah and then like you can't catch me you're kind of and then like that

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:11.140
Yeah...

00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:16.344
It was like a, like a really good, like a really power, like not like powerful, but like a...

00:06:16.344 --> 00:06:21.255
very exclusive or like i don't know like very yeah yeah
