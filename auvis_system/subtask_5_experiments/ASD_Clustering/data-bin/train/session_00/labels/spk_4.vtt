00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.205
Past and future.

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:53.546
Oh, wow, it's probably the last one.

00:00:53.546 --> 00:00:55.436

00:01:22.487 --> 00:01:23.525
Well...

00:01:25.457 --> 00:01:27.499
That's true.

00:01:53.368 --> 00:01:57.434
See, I I remember so little of that because I was I wasn't that old.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.255
Oh , oh, that one. Oh, you're talking about that one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. No, there was a...

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.379

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:30.626

00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:37.360
Oh, I thought It was, I don't remember being that amazing.

00:02:42.252 --> 00:02:47.301
Well, that was weather-related, yeah, yeah. You're talking about the one where we got all stuck, right? Because of the snowing?

00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:51.585
Yeah. But yeah, I still had fun though.

00:02:51.823 --> 00:02:55.434
But I feel bad for the kids not being able to go snowboarding and skiing.

00:02:59.198 --> 00:03:02.808
Yeah, but if the weather didn't get crazy, they might have gone.

00:03:05.373 --> 00:03:10.335
Oh, so skiing or snowboarding wasn't on the cards to begin with?

00:03:12.916 --> 00:03:14.637
They, that young?

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:20.949
Oh, that's right. I was with Sammy still. Yeah, yeah, yeah, a long time ago.

00:03:26.315 --> 00:03:31.294
But it was fun though. Yeah. Yeah.

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:34.534
Well, the crew's like, well, you know.

00:03:34.534 --> 00:03:39.853

00:03:39.528 --> 00:03:41.121
Yeah.

00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:47.326
Yeah, that's that's a lot.

00:03:48.016 --> 00:03:53.946
That's a lot. And then everybody that dropped off like flies getting sick, you know? 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.730
At the very end, remember like going home?

00:03:57.228 --> 00:04:01.212
No, no, no, yeah. Uh.

00:04:01.342 --> 00:04:05.753
Yeah, yeah. No, it was like, you know how you wake up early?

00:04:05.753 --> 00:04:09.481
To get off the roll? Yeah, that's when I started feeling it.

00:04:19.285 --> 00:04:23.605
Yeah, she was like fine. Well, she works as a nurse.

00:04:23.605 --> 00:04:26.642
So she's like vaccinated for everything.

00:04:26.188 --> 00:04:29.378
Also, yeah

00:04:33.444 --> 00:04:37.646

00:04:40.362 --> 00:04:44.125
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

00:04:47.045 --> 00:04:49.661
How many crews?

00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:52.547
I mean, if everybody went, I won't say no.

00:04:52.547 --> 00:04:57.542
But  It's a cruise is definitely not something I'm going to seek out. Especially not on Carnival.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.937
Yeah.

00:05:03.617 --> 00:05:08.404
Uh. I think I'd rather go on like a regular room in a different, just to try it out,

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.808
Like this cartologue.

00:05:13.353 --> 00:05:16.974
Yeah, and then when you look here on the news about like...

00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:19.424
Ships breaking down? It's always a carnival ship.

00:05:18.992 --> 00:05:23.326
Yeah, have you noticed that? It's always a carnival show.

00:05:30.834 --> 00:05:33.384
Oh heck yeah!

00:05:35.797 --> 00:05:38.155
Oh, that was loud.
