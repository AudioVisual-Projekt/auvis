00:00:33.877 --> 00:00:34.830
Yeah.

What about Shin Godzilla? That was powerful!

00:00:50.593 --> 00:00:51.774
But uglier.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.959
Ugly Godzilla.

Biollante! But we have to talk about Godzilla first. Your favorite Godzilla.

00:01:30.794 --> 00:01:33.443
The villain will come to, next. Yeah, yeah.

00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:40.294
He wasn't that enemy. Because Biollante was good.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.061

No, it should be 1990s.

00:02:04.527 --> 00:02:07.230
Yeah. Only came out once.

00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:13.912
