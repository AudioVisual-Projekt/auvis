00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:23.468
Okay, so we're talking about Finland.

00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.823
It was the summertime so because

00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:48.442
North part, it doesn't get dark till like

00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:51.329
10 30 at night

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.323
and then got really bright right by like 3 a.m

00:00:56.323 --> 00:01:01.200

00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:07.444

00:01:07.813 --> 00:01:09.177
yeah

00:01:13.468 --> 00:01:18.108
So they not only own the house on the island and I think on the island they're like

00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:21.974
I don't know how many houses, but maybe a dozen or so. It's a small island.

00:01:21.974 --> 00:01:26.968
about a dozen or so houses, but you can't see any other people.

00:01:26.968 --> 00:01:31.963
because it's like bushes in the backyard and stuff 

00:01:31.963 --> 00:01:35.388
Yeah, you kind of see that lights.

00:01:35.388 --> 00:01:38.444
and stuff like that but it's like just your

00:01:39.777 --> 00:01:44.585
Yeah, very private. and then So you need to own a house on the island.

00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:49.192
but you also need a boat that you can get on to get there.

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:53.900
