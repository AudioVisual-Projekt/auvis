Hmmmm...

00:02:34.847 --> 00:02:37.496
My favorite place.

00:02:37.496 --> 00:02:41.123
To visit is probably though Japan, my grandparents' house.

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:44.718
yeah

00:02:45.377 --> 00:02:48.903
You guys just like... Yeah.

00:02:48.903 --> 00:02:52.582
Like my grandparents are there and then I've known that house

00:02:52.582 --> 00:02:55.670
longer than I've known any other house in my life.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.665
Yeah, because we've moved a couple times but they've never moved

00:03:00.665 --> 00:03:01.543
So,

00:03:02.758 --> 00:03:06.368
Yeah, on my mom's side. no

00:03:06.368 --> 00:03:08.884
Yeah, not on my dad's side, on my mom's side.

00:03:08.884 --> 00:03:12.427
yeah so i think it's just like going there it's like a comfort place

00:03:12.427 --> 00:03:14.468
so

00:03:18.957 --> 00:03:23.682
oh my mother Yeah, I think my mom's calling them like every week.

00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:26.265
So they chat online and then...

00:03:26.265 --> 00:03:30.213
I think last time we visited I got to hear a lot of my

00:03:30.213 --> 00:03:34.703
my grandpa's like stories about when he was younger so

00:03:34.703 --> 00:03:38.651
It was like when he was starting off as a pastor.

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:43.073
and things like that so it was really like yeah

00:03:43.073 --> 00:03:47.578
He's still a tapster. Yeah, he still helps out. 

00:03:47.578 --> 00:03:50.531
That too. ha ha yeah

00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:53.045
so

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:58.040
yeah so he was i was able to hear a lot of i think like he tried really hard to share

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.555
I like as much as he could.

00:04:00.555 --> 00:04:03.558
yeah yeah yeah

00:04:03.558 --> 00:04:07.794
yeah so we got to hear a lot I think my mom took a lot of notes

00:04:07.794 --> 00:04:11.996
And then we kind of got to hear about his family too.

00:04:11.996 --> 00:04:14.408
and he was like It was really cool to hear about.

00:04:14.932 --> 00:04:19.218
yeah just how it was like and then my grandpa's

00:04:19.218 --> 00:04:23.151
father so he how he became a Christian

00:04:23.151 --> 00:04:27.892
yeah yeah he is a second generation

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:32.348
Yeah, on my mom's side. 

00:04:32.348 --> 00:04:34.474
Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.772
3.5!

00:04:39.772 --> 00:04:44.058
yeah 3.5 generations 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:48.833
Fascinating lesson. 

00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:56.361
But it's just... I don't know. But like...

00:04:57.171 --> 00:04:59.667
I think just like the way he...

00:04:59.667 --> 00:05:03.008
like he's continued

00:05:03.008 --> 00:05:05.524
to follow Jesus even though he's gone through

00:05:05.524 --> 00:05:10.164
Some things like I can't imagine being like being a Christian.

00:05:12.104 --> 00:05:17.099
(***)Yeah, he did so it was like

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.335
and then he's here now and I feel like he's like

00:05:22.078 --> 00:05:25.335
he was so faithful and then now he's like

00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:28.878
he still is and then

00:05:28.878 --> 00:05:33.638
i can see that so i think that was just like a privilege to be able to hear that

00:05:33.638 --> 00:05:36.893
Yeah, yeah, and then

00:05:36.893 --> 00:05:41.012
you know God has continued to bless the family and then I'm here.

00:05:41.652 --> 00:05:45.450
with the same faith now so

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:51.794
I don't know but

00:05:51.794 --> 00:05:55.339
I still think he was, yeah

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:59.354
Yeah, yeah, yeah, a lot of different, yeah.

00:05:59.354 --> 00:06:04.349
yeah yeah yeah

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:08.214
oh yeah yeah

00:06:08.214 --> 00:06:12.095
I think they came here when Shokun was little

00:06:12.095 --> 00:06:16.938
So they visited and then we've been visiting them since yeah

00:06:16.938 --> 00:06:20.921
Yeah.
