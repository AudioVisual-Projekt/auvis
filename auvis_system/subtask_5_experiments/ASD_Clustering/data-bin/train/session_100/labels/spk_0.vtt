WEBVTT

00:00:25.753 --> 00:00:26.385
Okay.

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.811
um...

00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:41.682
You have to choose a dangerous place?

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:48.380
Yeah.

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:50.449
Yeah.

00:00:52.716 --> 00:00:53.529
me...

00:00:56.058 --> 00:00:56.848
Uh-huh.

00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:11.281
Is it before or after the... everything happens?

00:01:11.834 --> 00:01:16.394
If it's before that it's very dangerous. If it's after it's not as dangerous.

00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:20.945
Uh-huh.

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:25.007
Yes. Everything is middle earth.

00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:27.980
Yeah. Rohan.

00:01:28.494 --> 00:01:33.234
No, it's underwater. Oh, yeah. I think

00:01:33.234 --> 00:01:35.749
that would be a nice place to live though.

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:39.040
After the war. It's really, it's really free. Lots of

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.228
black grass. Yeah.

00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:49.556
mmh

00:01:58.058 --> 00:01:59.099
Morgoth.

00:02:00.014 --> 00:02:01.317
Morgoth...

00:02:01.887 --> 00:02:02.796
Um...

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.431
I would choose...

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:12.891
No. It's not there after the war. I think dangerous I'll have

00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:15.581
to... choose...

00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:18.102
Ummm...

00:02:18.695 --> 00:02:23.472
If I were going to choose one dangerous place...

00:02:23.472 --> 00:02:28.416
But I might choose Morgoth too. Because there's some parts that aren't too bad.

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:30.187
Yeah.

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:37.713
Oh... I think Morgoth is from mostly Hobbit.

00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:40.229
So, it's when the giant spiders 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:44.548
come out. And then, It's where the wood-elves live. Yeah.

00:02:46.456 --> 00:02:49.427
I think Woodland Kingdom wouldn't count as a dangerous place.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.829
It depends on if you're on the Elves good side or not.

00:02:55.686 --> 00:03:00.630
Yeah, they could be very mean. They're not as wise as the other elves.

00:03:03.061 --> 00:03:04.579
Yeah that too.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.104
You have a favorite scene from Lord of the Ring?

00:03:16.198 --> 00:03:18.777
It could be book or movie.

00:03:25.724 --> 00:03:28.259
Moria? Oh, the...

00:03:31.238 --> 00:03:32.462
Ohhh...

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.777
I think the battle team. But they find it worse too.

00:03:36.777 --> 00:03:41.097
um... that's a real defense too.

00:03:41.097 --> 00:03:42.089
Yeah.

00:03:42.852 --> 00:03:43.642
Yeah.

00:03:48.708 --> 00:03:52.533
My favorite scene. That's so hard, but...

00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:54.281
Ohhh...

00:03:57.313 --> 00:04:00.621
Favorite. Oh, but I think one of my favorite from the book

00:04:00.621 --> 00:04:03.607
It's when the hobbits meet Aragorn for the first time.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.352
When I start listening to Fellowship, I'm going on audiobooks.

00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:10.274
I always start with that part.

00:04:10.156 --> 00:04:11.766
Where they meet him. 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.872
Yeah.

00:04:22.113 --> 00:04:22.824
mmh

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.634
Ohhh... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

00:04:28.594 --> 00:04:32.117
Yeah, yeah, yeah. and then Gandalf like

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:37.158
you don't need me anymore. You guys can do this. And they really did it.

00:04:41.424 --> 00:04:43.262
That's so true!

00:04:44.218 --> 00:04:45.126
Yeah.

00:04:45.666 --> 00:04:46.456
Yeah.

00:04:47.762 --> 00:04:48.512
Yeah.

00:04:50.095 --> 00:04:50.885
Yeah.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.282
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The Hobbits. They're the warriors.

00:04:58.282 --> 00:05:03.176
He's beating everyone else. I see, that's really cool. Yeah.

00:05:03.176 --> 00:05:04.014
Yeah.

00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:07.049
Yeah. And they go together.

00:05:10.467 --> 00:05:14.178
Yeah. That's such a really good part. Yeah...

00:05:14.466 --> 00:05:16.915
Uhhh... hmmm...

00:05:17.627 --> 00:05:18.457
hmm...

00:05:20.258 --> 00:05:20.929
Yeah.

00:05:23.774 --> 00:05:24.722
Uh-huh.

00:05:25.856 --> 00:05:26.647
Uh-huh.

00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:34.902
Oh, Faramir. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:36.505 --> 00:05:39.272
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:40.017
Yeah.

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:42.020
Yeah. It isn't in the movie.

00:05:42.168 --> 00:05:43.076
There's ten...

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:47.907
They have too. They have five seconds scene.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.950
They fall in love in five seconds in the movie.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.424
It's really short in the book too, I heard like some readers complain that it was too short.

00:05:56.385 --> 00:05:59.282
um... but, I think it's good. 

00:06:00.585 --> 00:06:02.890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:04.837 --> 00:06:08.381
Yeah. Yes, it's true. But they're like

00:06:08.381 --> 00:06:12.515
Eowyn's character development, you can really see that.

00:06:12.918 --> 00:06:13.629
Yeah.

00:06:15.976 --> 00:06:18.983
Yeah, that's true. I like it too.

00:06:19.417 --> 00:06:23.064
Wait. I don't know how interested you are, sorry to ask.

00:06:22.985 --> 00:06:25.291
But do you have a favorite romance?

00:06:25.291 --> 00:06:28.551
From Lord of the ring. There's a lot.

00:06:28.986 --> 00:06:31.871
I know there's some romantic ones there for you.
