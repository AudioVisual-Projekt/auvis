Mordor... eh. Okay.

00:00:49.596 --> 00:00:51.809
I don't want to live there.

00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:56.968
Wait. Okay, I don't remember the names of all the places.

00:00:57.814 --> 00:00:59.015

Oh, everything is a rock. Rohan.

00:01:29.877 --> 00:01:31.901
Èowyn and Èomer.

00:01:40.317 --> 00:01:40.993
Yeah.

00:01:49.874 --> 00:01:51.949
So, you'll live in Isengard?

00:02:29.598 --> 00:02:32.719
Morgoth. What happens in Morgoth?

00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:35.446
I don't know the names of the place, but I remember.

00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:38.726
Yeah.

00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:43.908
Okay.

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:56.239
They could be mean.

00:03:08.241 --> 00:03:09.809
Yeah....

00:03:10.564 --> 00:03:11.597
Gondor.

00:03:18.737 --> 00:03:22.114
Lord of the ring movie, favorite scene...

00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:32.552
Okay.

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:37.707

Yeah?...

00:04:10.262 --> 00:04:11.096
Oh.

00:04:15.808 --> 00:04:19.235
Oh, I like the tip.

00:04:19.235 --> 00:04:21.833
the very ending of the book where like

00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:26.018
before it comes back. And they like...

00:04:26.187 --> 00:04:31.014
They rally everybody to like fight like elves. Ooh...

00:04:32.986 --> 00:04:33.940
What...

00:04:35.165 --> 00:04:38.758
It's... it is fine. I was like Oh

00:04:38.758 --> 00:04:41.138
They're all grown up now.

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:47.078
Right. right. And then I'm like... oh...

00:04:47.858 --> 00:04:49.379
It's just it's...

00:04:50.015 --> 00:04:55.010
It's so nice where you have the helpless little almost child like

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.579
The Hobbit, and at the end they all... yeah.

00:05:01.881 --> 00:05:02.517
yeah 

00:05:05.083 --> 00:05:05.918
Yeah.

00:05:13.166 --> 00:05:14.056
Yeah.

00:05:19.082 --> 00:05:19.877
Yeah.

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:25.924
Oh, the other scene that the movie cut out is like that where Èowyn

00:05:25.924 --> 00:05:30.734
and what, what was the name of that dude, they kind of get together?

00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:33.248
or grow to... Yeah.

00:05:33.248 --> 00:05:36.589
Where they... I, I like that development,

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:39.238
of that relationship which

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:41.888
you don't see it all in the movie and...

00:05:50.835 --> 00:05:51.578
Yeah.

00:05:57.835 --> 00:06:00.654
But... It was just right.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.251
Just right, but you, you see that change in time.

00:06:06.276 --> 00:06:06.951
Yeah.

00:06:11.408 --> 00:06:12.202
Yeah.

00:06:12.483 --> 00:06:17.443
Or, I think they could have made a book on this that's that too.

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:18.351
Like...
