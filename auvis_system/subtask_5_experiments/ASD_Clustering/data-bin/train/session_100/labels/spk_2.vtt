WEBVTT

00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:18.822
uhmm

00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:33.942
Okay, so continuing with...evict ef...

00:00:33.942 --> 00:00:39.339
Oh, if you were able to choose one of the dangerous places in Middle Earth to live, where would you choose?

00:00:39.982 --> 00:00:41.820
Yeah, a dangerous place.

00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:03.541
So, I think the, one of the most safest places is Isengard.

00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:07.438
Isengard. It's kind of dangerous, but like... but...

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.174
Oh, uh I don't know.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.876
Oh, I guess.

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:23.959
Eve- everything is a mirror.

00:01:26.103 --> 00:01:29.072
Don't live in Nùmenor, don't live in Nùmenor.

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:32.700
You'll be a tea. You'll be a tea person.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.705
I guess.

00:01:36.573 --> 00:01:37.358
Yup.

00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:43.991
Everything's flat. It's so flat in your face uh like...

00:01:43.991 --> 00:01:48.395
They'll have to make horse crossings eventually. Yes, horse.

00:01:51.887 --> 00:01:54.402
Oh, I don't know, maybe after the war. But I...

00:01:54.402 --> 00:01:57.516
I was talking more like kind of dangerous place, like Morgoth.

00:01:59.059 --> 00:02:04.174
Yeah. Morgoth.... don't Gondor.

00:02:05.647 --> 00:02:08.390
But actually No, it won't be there after the war.

00:02:13.564 --> 00:02:14.846
Woodland.

00:02:21.806 --> 00:02:22.611
Yeah.

00:02:24.951 --> 00:02:25.997
I guess.

00:02:27.386 --> 00:02:31.318
Yeah, like the place I'm about to guess. There's a lot of mushrooms.

00:02:40.257 --> 00:02:41.223
Yeah.

00:02:43.728 --> 00:02:46.898
Oh, If you were to live in Woodland, Woodland Kingdom.

00:02:48.976 --> 00:02:51.456
Yeah. I guess. No. Yeah, about the...

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:54.376
I guess.

00:02:57.195 --> 00:02:58.977
They're not as wise.

00:02:59.816 --> 00:03:03.662
But then in some parts, they're actually less vital than dwarves.

00:03:04.466 --> 00:03:06.654
They got no batteries.

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:18.123
Oh, favorite scene from Lord of the rings.

00:03:18.591 --> 00:03:19.798
Uh....

00:03:22.033 --> 00:03:24.380
I guess maybe from the book I like the...

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.020
In Moria. Moria, where they come like the

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.476
bad little inside the chamber thing. In the book. I like that one.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:37.776
Yeah.

00:03:38.942 --> 00:03:43.414
That's my favorite book. Yeah, it's very well written.

00:03:47.025 --> 00:03:48.502
What's your favorite scene?

00:04:02.931 --> 00:04:05.124
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:08.964 --> 00:04:11.050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Aahhh...

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.371
Yeah, that takes me a bit far.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.496
Aahhh...

00:04:28.788 --> 00:04:29.471

Yeah. Yeah, they really did it.

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:38.486
Yeah. They really did it.

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:45.717
And then they defeat... And then they defeat all the bad guys. Yeah.

00:04:45.717 --> 00:04:50.544
Like they're, like they're the strong warriors from far away land.

00:04:55.076 --> 00:04:55.800

00:05:00.464 --> 00:05:01.324
Yeah.

00:05:01.967 --> 00:05:05.866
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a, there's a legendary warriors at the end.

00:05:05.866 --> 00:05:10.861
They start out listening to the legendary warriors and at the end they are the legendary warriors.

00:05:11.665 --> 00:05:12.641
Yeah.

00:05:16.165 --> 00:05:17.010
Yeah.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.443

Oh, Yeah, yea, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.306
Oh, like... and they send it eventually like one night one night.

00:05:44.306 --> 00:05:46.607
Small scene, like five seconds long.

00:05:50.038 --> 00:05:52.788
Yeah... They had...

00:05:55.217 --> 00:05:56.022

00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:01.806
Yeah.

00:06:03.713 --> 00:06:07.003
Yeah. I mean, they are kind, they're kind of sidetracked after all.

00:06:10.865 --> 00:06:11.589
yeah 

00:06:12.433 --> 00:06:13.117
Yeah.

00:06:16.305 --> 00:06:17.552
Yeah. I guess.

00:06:18.663 --> 00:06:19.347
Yeah.

00:06:19.894 --> 00:06:20.835
Yeah.
