00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.949
I'm on call for a year. Yeah, so...

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.779
They can like call me like whenever to notify that.

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:44.775
I have to, like, attempt the journey. Yeah. So, hard to say.

00:00:44.775 --> 00:00:49.718
For a year. Yeah. Like um like when I got my orientation.

00:00:49.718 --> 00:00:52.234
Next year January

00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:57.228
In 2026, I'm on call for, for that year, that whole year. Yeah.

00:00:57.228 --> 00:01:02.224
For that case. Which would last anywhere from 6 months to a year. Yup.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.735
pretty much yeah

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:12.685
Um...

00:01:14.492 --> 00:01:17.697
Yeah, they do but um I already gave them like

00:01:17.697 --> 00:01:21.882
my calendar, so they know when I will be back. Yeah.

00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:25.224
So I, I probably just can't like

00:01:25.224 --> 00:01:28.720
um create like new like travel itineraries.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:31.906
