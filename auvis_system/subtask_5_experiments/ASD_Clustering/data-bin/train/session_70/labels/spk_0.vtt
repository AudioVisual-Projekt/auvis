Yeah. Then, I mean, this is not about the trip, but...

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:57.142
just listening to my story so my kikis

00:03:57.142 --> 00:04:01.327
The castle is based on the Kochi castle.

00:04:01.327 --> 00:04:06.255
where the founder, Pastor Okumura was born and raised, right?

00:04:06.255 --> 00:04:10.810
And then the inside is imitating the church building.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.489
which (***) which is in Osaka.

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.893
(***) Oh, inside?

00:04:18.893 --> 00:04:21.357
So Makiki's inside is like this, right?

00:04:21.863 --> 00:04:25.643
and then Osaka church where he served.

00:04:25.643 --> 00:04:29.862
is like this. Exactly the same inside.

00:04:29.862 --> 00:04:32.073
So they, he copied.

00:04:32.376 --> 00:04:35.145
the image or the style.

00:04:35.145 --> 00:04:40.140
of Osaka church where he grew up or he was trained so 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.008
yeah yeah yeah

00:04:43.008 --> 00:04:48.004
Yeah, I didn't. Well, I knew about the Coachcastle, but when I went

00:04:48.004 --> 00:04:52.374
to Osaka church as a part of the mission trip from Makiki.

00:04:52.374 --> 00:04:54.888
Everybody's like, oh, this is monkey.

00:04:54.888 --> 00:04:58.836
I mean they didn't have the ceiling where all the pictures were but yeah.

00:05:02.232 --> 00:05:03.680
yeah

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.105
You have any place where you were like surprised that wasn't?

00:05:07.105 --> 00:05:09.552
what you have (***) London?

00:05:15.477 --> 00:05:16.434
oh

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.809
ah yeah Yes, everything is small.

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:24.268
 narrow  

00:05:40.383 --> 00:05:45.126
Well, but that's where we were. We were in the apartment flats. That's why.

00:05:45.126 --> 00:05:49.513
if you go to countryside of course it's much more yeah

00:05:49.513 --> 00:05:52.145
Center City, yeah

00:05:54.825 --> 00:05:55.845
you do

00:05:56.093 --> 00:06:00.313
No, no, no, no, no. Even in the city. City? Yeah.

00:06:00.313 --> 00:06:02.826
If you juggle around.

00:06:02.826 --> 00:06:05.426
Because when I first went.

00:06:05.426 --> 00:06:10.285
I went to London Japanese Christian Church and they have a house

00:06:10.285 --> 00:06:14.167
It's about maybe 10 minutes from where we stayed.
