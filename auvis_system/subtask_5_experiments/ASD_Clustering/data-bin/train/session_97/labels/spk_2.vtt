WEBVTT

00:00:15.526 --> 00:00:17.079
Okay, so

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:25.836
okay so other gojiras which which is the  second favorite

00:00:25.836 --> 00:00:28.065
of the movie.

00:00:31.068 --> 00:00:33.042
Which Hollywood one did you like?

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:41.817
Yeah... I think King of Monsters the Godzilla was meaner

00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:48.432
Yeah...Wait, the Kingdom Monsters? Basically...

00:00:48.432 --> 00:00:53.427
The Godzilla was responding to all other kaiju or the monsters.

00:00:53.427 --> 00:00:55.014
around the world.

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:04.666
Yeah...  Because he's a titan, right? He's a titan.

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:07.180
So he ...

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.670
He needs to let the other monsters know that I rule, not you, Palutene.

00:01:11.647 --> 00:01:16.642
yeah so if everything everybody becomes subdivisive then he's okay

00:01:16.664 --> 00:01:18.538
Okay.

00:01:24.157 --> 00:01:28.155
Yeah...Well, which one other than Godzilla?

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:33.101
Which monster was your favorite?

00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:33.319
been.

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:43.901
He came from know.. He's supposed to be came from the space, right?

00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:43.951
you

00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:55.375
He was in the ice frozen and then the humans decided to melt the ice.

00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:59.054
And I...Who's the bad guy?

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:02.749
Hmmm.

00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:05.652
So, okay, so what?

00:02:06.567 --> 00:02:08.560
Hmm...

00:02:09.163 --> 00:02:12.705
So he was... so that guy is the one that who...

00:02:19.393 --> 00:02:20.589
Hmm...

00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:25.429
I didn't know that part. Okay..So he was the one that who basically...

00:02:25.407 --> 00:02:29.879
(***) Melt the ice and then let the king get out.

00:02:29.924 --> 00:02:31.865
Yeah, 

00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:35.808
Okay, okay... so...

00:02:41.748 --> 00:02:45.004
The king guitar was bigger.

00:02:47.621 --> 00:02:51.080
But in the King Guido, I mean

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.011
Ghidorah came out too, but Mothra came out too, right?

00:02:55.056 --> 00:02:59.309
But Masuda was to come and destroy Godzilla, right?

00:03:02.672 --> 00:03:04.815
Masuda.... Really?

00:03:05.612 --> 00:03:07.383
Hmmmmmmmm...

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:15.784
So Rodan is the one that came out of the volcano. Okay

00:03:19.818 --> 00:03:24.458
They basically back up each other to defeat Godzilla.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.909
So.. Among the monsters that fought against Godzilla,

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.064
Which one do you think was the strongest?

00:03:37.064 --> 00:03:42.059
King  Ghidorah  but King Ghidorah thought...

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:44.843
It destroys

00:03:44.843 --> 00:03:48.184
It killed Godzilla when Godzilla came back.

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:53.939
The human is the one who destroyed Godzilla?

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:58.326
Hmmmmmmmm...

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.869
King of Monsters? Godzilla dies once?

00:04:04.266 --> 00:04:05.684
Ohhh....I see, I see.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.181
Is that is that when the the guy who

00:04:12.203 --> 00:04:16.304
went down to the bottom of the ocean to look for Godzilla

00:04:16.304 --> 00:04:21.063
And then he actually...

00:04:31.823 --> 00:04:32.397
Okay.

00:04:38.034 --> 00:04:41.880
Okay.  Ohhhhh... I see..

00:04:46.707 --> 00:04:51.399
He doesn't need air because he's a space monster.

00:04:51.465 --> 00:04:53.254
But Godzilla doesn't know that.

00:04:54.552 --> 00:04:57.143
Ohhhh...

00:04:57.356 --> 00:05:01.305
Okay...okay so by Godzilla pulling the Ghidorah down

00:05:01.327 --> 00:05:03.824
They thought that Ghidorah was going to die.

00:05:07.041 --> 00:05:09.825
but the Godzilla and Ghidorah did not die.

00:05:09.914 --> 00:05:14.437
Basically. So whatever the human was doing wasn't really working.

00:05:21.705 --> 00:05:25.284
yeah he basically set the atomic bomb yeah

00:05:26.398 --> 00:05:27.527
Yeah...

00:05:30.092 --> 00:05:31.665
Yeah.. Thats true

00:05:31.786 --> 00:05:36.781
So but they decided to do that because they thought

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:41.174
Godzilla was the only hope to destroy other monsters.

00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:48.318
But Ghidorah was, you said, almost twice as big as Godzilla.

00:05:50.596 --> 00:05:53.734
Because  of the neck right next kind of make

00:06:00.366 --> 00:06:03.337
Really? Because he was twice as tall.

00:06:13.815 --> 00:06:18.102
Okay, but it was taller.
