WEBVTT

00:00:16.372 --> 00:00:21.367
So now on to other Godzilla we're talking about.

00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:21.520
you

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:31.813
second favorite i guess i kind of like the hollywood godzillas too like

00:00:31.813 --> 00:00:36.809
I don't know, Godzilla vs. Kong was good, but I kinda like King of Monsters, too.

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:36.842
you

00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:43.552
Yeah,... A little mean, but then he was on the good side at the end.

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:47.709
Yeah...

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:50.572
Yeah...   Yeah...

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:57.076
Kinda, yeah. In those stories, mostly like...

00:00:57.076 --> 00:01:01.597
Godzilla only comes out when there's a threatening monster showing up.

00:01:02.918 --> 00:01:07.643
and he's like the king of the monster so he has to do it so he like any like

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.418
Yeah...   Yeah...

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.558
Yeah...

00:01:17.308 --> 00:01:21.966
Most of the Titans are kind of inactive.

00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:25.453
But then there are hundreds of them like they're everywhere

00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:29.773
Yeah...

00:01:33.373 --> 00:01:36.951
I kind of like the King Ghidorah of the King of Monsters.

00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:41.525
you know the way yeah that that was good like you know like moving that

00:01:43.448 --> 00:01:48.442
Yeah...   But then like he was like like when they first found it was like in ice

00:01:51.514 --> 00:01:53.458
Yeah...   Yeah...

00:01:55.496 --> 00:01:57.995
The bad guy. I wanted to melt the ice.

00:01:57.995 --> 00:02:01.284
But yeah, he died in like the middle of the movie but

00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:17.096
The one who attacked the place where the monster was the first.

00:02:17.096 --> 00:02:21.298
at the first part of Kiyomata. You might not remember it though.

00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:26.349
Yeah...

00:02:29.838 --> 00:02:33.314
Yeah, I forgot how, why, but I don't remember.

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:38.679
Then yeah, he woke up and then Godzilla came and they kind of fought.

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:41.464
but then King Ghidorah is much bigger than Godzilla in that movie.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.412
Yeah...much bigger has like a big wings wings and

00:02:53.698 --> 00:02:55.522
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that one also came out.

00:02:58.475 --> 00:03:02.474
No, Master didn't come to destroy Gordie. Master was on OGSI.

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:05.257
Yeah... Yeah..

00:03:05.257 --> 00:03:09.240
It's a run-on, um, run-on, Rona.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.468
Rona was on Kingi's side mostly.

00:03:14.337 --> 00:03:17.036
Yeah, he was kinda like, can you do a side flip?

00:03:17.036 --> 00:03:19.670
I mean they did fight at the first part but then like...

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.916
But then at the end, Rodin also bowed down to Godzilla.

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:34.693
Yeah...

00:03:36.308 --> 00:03:38.721
King Ghidorah, definitely.

00:03:48.266 --> 00:03:51.388
Actually, it's only the people who destroyed Gojira the first time.

00:03:53.655 --> 00:03:57.301
The first time, yeah. That's when he came back.

00:03:57.301 --> 00:04:00.709
So they kind of like, they like, yeah.

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.982
Well, not like he died. I saw he died one time.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.677
So they said like the oxygen destroyer

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.327
The distroyer oxygen... Yeah

00:04:13.657 --> 00:04:15.159
Yeah...

00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:17.433
Yeah...

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:22.477
So the oxygen destroyer came out. like  that...

00:04:22.477 --> 00:04:25.567
The military decided they want to get rid of all the monsters, so...

00:04:25.567 --> 00:04:30.562
At one point, Godzilla took down Ghidorah and like really dragged it into the ocean and

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:34.459
fighting him underwater. But then...

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:38.171
Basically, the military basically sent the missile... Ahhh.. 

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.827
to try to destroy both of them

00:04:40.805 --> 00:04:45.800
But then Ghidorah didn't need oxygen to breathe, to not breathe, but to live.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.339
No, he doesn't. He's a space monster.

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:51.553
Yeah.

00:04:53.308 --> 00:04:56.346
Well, the people didn't really know that.

00:05:01.577 --> 00:05:06.572
Actually, Godzilla would have... Yeah, like, both of them would basically die in the...

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:11.348
Nothing.. Yeah....   Yeah...

00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:18.166
No, I think it goes to kind of like a very damaged.

00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:21.507
but then that's why they sent the guy down to um...

00:05:23.998 --> 00:05:26.732
Yeah to basically recharge Godzilla.

00:05:26.688 --> 00:05:30.180
So in the end, I got that it's powered by atomic energy.

00:05:39.344 --> 00:05:43.445
The Ghidorah, yeah. Ghidorah was the  good.

00:05:48.118 --> 00:05:51.577
twice as big oh i guess kind of twice as big

00:05:51.577 --> 00:05:54.413
And that goes like, there's one scene where like...

00:05:54.413 --> 00:05:57.164
but the standard you draw like basically folds itself to it.

00:05:57.164 --> 00:06:02.159
full height it's like looks twice as tall yeah

00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:06.096
Not really. I think KBD or I don't know, somewhere like...

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:08.707
Maybe 150.

00:06:08.707 --> 00:06:13.702
meters, probably got to maybe 120 meters, but I think it's not much taller

00:06:13.702 --> 00:06:16.873
But other than that, yeah.
