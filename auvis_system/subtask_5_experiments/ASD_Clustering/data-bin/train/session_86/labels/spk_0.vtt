00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:24.501
What? Hi!

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.250
How are you? Okay, so the best fight seems to...

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.455
It was Whamu versus Joseph in the best moment.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.758
The best moment. I'm telling you this again.

00:00:34.758 --> 00:00:37.627
And again, this moment changed my life.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.622
He threw. I don't even remember what happened. I just remember the intensity of the moment.

00:00:54.628 --> 00:00:58.723
Yup, I don't even know the specific. I just remember how fantastic.

00:01:01.253 --> 00:01:04.388
Yup, anyway, I cannot believe

00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:09.383
It was like absolutely phenomenal in battle and I want to watch it again and it changed my life.

00:01:09.516 --> 00:01:13.470
Like, I came in that battle thinking it was just going to be Oh, another battle.

00:01:13.304 --> 00:01:16.946
um a horse race that's kind of, you know, mid- middle.

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:18.545
normal

00:01:20.776 --> 00:01:26.071
and that wasn't even the main battle. It was just randomly the funniest and best genius

00:01:26.038 --> 00:01:28.287
battle ever. And the best thing about it

00:01:28.287 --> 00:01:31.240
Was that nobody?

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.682
even like they were trying to act like it was all about about

00:01:36.315 --> 00:01:39.156
um his brain or something.

00:01:43.272 --> 00:01:46.022
Rem being smart and

00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:46.906
him

00:01:50.508 --> 00:01:55.017
But instead of him being smart and producing something, he just did something random.

00:01:55.017 --> 00:01:58.295
and he got lucky. That's basically it.

00:02:15.104 --> 00:02:16.636
Ohhhh...

00:02:22.844 --> 00:02:26.016
That's though....

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:32.796
I know. I can't believe that he did that and he predicted everything.

00:02:33.762 --> 00:02:36.157
Anyway, let's keep talking about um

00:02:37.778 --> 00:02:42.773
Let's keep talking about China. Okay, so there was this great city in China. It's called

00:02:42.773 --> 00:02:46.840
Cheng Chengdu Chengdu. Yeah.

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:53.286
Taiwan has

00:02:53.286 --> 00:02:56.071
has a Taichung

00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:58.974
You can give a... Taichung.

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:01.865
Ohhh...

00:03:02.297 --> 00:03:04.389
I have no idea about pilots.

00:03:07.798 --> 00:03:10.936
Chengdu is in China. it's like

00:03:10.936 --> 00:03:14.716
Not near the center, but it's not near any of the edges.

00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:18.412
really. But anyway, it's famous for

00:03:18.412 --> 00:03:22.159
Bamboo. Yeah!

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.061
Also, it has... a

00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:27.997
panda. It's like one of the most panda places.

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:38.815
Chimpanzee. I don't know. Did you know that the only country with

00:03:38.815 --> 00:03:42.054
cat cat pandas is Chengdu.

00:03:42.054 --> 00:03:47.049
only prat prat country pandas

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.318
sorry... China. And I wonder why.

00:03:51.718 --> 00:03:54.626
I think it's because they have the most mass bamboo workshops.

00:03:55.292 --> 00:03:58.542
Oh, I think my teacher said that

00:03:59.374 --> 00:04:03.536
because the pandas eat

00:04:04.336 --> 00:04:05.647
are still permit...

00:04:07.283 --> 00:04:07.949
What?

00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:11.177
Yeah, because the pandas eat so stupid.

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:13.230
 yeah.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.636
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I watched that video.

00:04:21.036 --> 00:04:22.686
On Instagram or something?

00:04:23.751 --> 00:04:28.460
Yeah, and it was so cute, even the way he broke the bamboo is like

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.768
because they're dumb. Their, they kinda like

00:04:31.768 --> 00:04:33.979
Her lips but not looking  the best.

00:04:35.126 --> 00:04:39.721
Not really? They're less dumb. Well Gorillas are like...

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.295
Oh, yeah. They can do things, they can learn things, but they're stupid.

00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:53.182
Just like pandas. I think pandas are less creepy, like pandas don't...

00:04:54.148 --> 00:04:56.702
Yeah, they're cute. They're the cute version.

00:04:58.134 --> 00:04:58.982
Yeah.

00:05:00.861 --> 00:05:05.323
Yeah like grandpa uh I was,  I was 

00:05:09.366 --> 00:05:14.161
Yes, so you think kat , she think kat and it's like 

00:05:14.395 --> 00:05:16.116
She saw that online.

00:05:16.891 --> 00:05:21.886
That was crazy. I don't even know what the deal is real.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.290
only listening and it brings out the mom talking though.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.783
Which is the point, right?

00:05:36.316 --> 00:05:39.960
But we were talking about China and then it moved on to something and I don't even know what happened.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.701
China that's what I'm talking about right now. Yeah. Chengdu.

00:05:44.901 --> 00:05:49.297
The best job. We went to Chinatown. The best city in the whole China. 

00:05:50.896 --> 00:05:51.979
And uh

00:05:52.545 --> 00:05:54.794
And exactly and there's bamboo

00:05:54.794 --> 00:05:59.282
Okay, let me tell you about my Chinese friend. Her name is Colleen, and I just texted her today.

00:05:59.282 --> 00:06:02.960

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.504
and, and uh I just texted

00:06:06.504 --> 00:06:08.896

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:14.188
Yeah, exactly and her name is Colleen. And she's from Chengdu.

00:06:14.588 --> 00:06:19.583

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:22.599
Like soup, like bamboo shoot, you know.
