WEBVTT

00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:40.150
oh their history

00:00:52.664 --> 00:00:56.996
the (***)

00:00:58.787 --> 00:01:00.187
ohhh

00:01:09.193 --> 00:01:11.690
It's another book that she likes.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.685
(***)

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.247
Which one?

00:01:36.373 --> 00:01:38.768
oh the (***)

00:01:47.093 --> 00:01:49.592
That knows all the characters.

00:01:49.592 --> 00:01:52.309
When she was little

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:57.304
Before Lord of the Rings, it was Narnia. right?

00:01:57.304 --> 00:01:57.337
you

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.525
when I think you were like still 10 or something I walked into their house

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:09.453
They have a history, timeline of what happened.

00:02:09.453 --> 00:02:11.715
And she wrote the whole thing

00:02:14.448 --> 00:02:15.949
Yeah.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.903
They've already grown up. haahaa

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:17.290
(***)

00:03:34.306 --> 00:03:35.867
oh

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:44.089
I don't remember that

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:48.087
I read it, I read it, but I don't remember that in detail.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.643
haahaa

00:04:00.861 --> 00:04:04.591
The most important...

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.854
Like all the clip parts too? In the book?

00:04:22.836 --> 00:04:24.343
ah hh

00:04:25.888 --> 00:04:28.874
haahaa

00:04:53.883 --> 00:04:56.972
It's not a literature class, it's a language class.

00:05:03.246 --> 00:05:05.130
oh wow

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.804
Wow, that's powerful.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.951
yeah ahh

00:05:35.902 --> 00:05:40.054
So for the movie that you're talking about, wow.

00:05:41.335 --> 00:05:45.638
Those are the top two, but what's the number three?

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:50.802
So far so far nothing like

00:05:50.802 --> 00:05:54.717
Like it moves your heart, it's like comedy.

00:06:09.854 --> 00:06:10.917
yeah Inspirational.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.111
for The first time.
