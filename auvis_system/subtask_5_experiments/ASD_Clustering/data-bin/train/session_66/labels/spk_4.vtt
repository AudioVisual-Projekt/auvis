WEBVTT

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.222
oh Okay, 

00:00:17.222 --> 00:00:22.218
begins (***) is

00:00:22.218 --> 00:00:24.816
I wonder...

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:29.575
yeah it's for the real Godzilla that the one that with the boy and you know when the Godzilla started

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:32.325
I mean the camera.

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:36.375
yeah (***) They both start with a G

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:41.371
 they're both bears and they're monsters.

00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:44.188
In Gamera, you know...

00:00:44.188 --> 00:00:46.804
One thing that I always wonder is...

00:00:47.243 --> 00:00:50.855
How can the gamera start spinning and able to fly?

00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:54.078
So how did that work?

00:00:59.691 --> 00:01:01.295
haahaa

00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:05.164
joke well in the animation

00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:09.028
Gamera was able to control he was only getting a fire from

00:01:09.028 --> 00:01:11.728
Back leg, not the front leg.

00:01:11.728 --> 00:01:15.155
So he was like doing this and then flying.

00:01:18.052 --> 00:01:19.845
yeah

00:01:21.076 --> 00:01:25.481
So here's the one scene in animation.

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:29.498
I think his legs were hurt.

00:01:29.498 --> 00:01:32.248
Arms got cut off.

00:01:32.873 --> 00:01:37.649
Yeah, one of his arms got cut off. Was it a hand?

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.905
And then he was able to still...

00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:43.469
I think he has a hand?

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.356
And they have their flippers.

00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.232
so I know.

00:01:51.232 --> 00:01:55.568
Does he have six legs? Belly haahaa

00:01:55.568 --> 00:01:59.906
because flipper was like on the next day when the two legs I mean

00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:03.399
One leg was being cut off. So that was interesting.

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.623
When he was flying you could see the flippers on the side.

00:02:06.623 --> 00:02:10.588
and then it looks like he still has four legs

00:02:13.627 --> 00:02:18.097
(***) armpit jits oh  from armpits

00:02:26.097 --> 00:02:26.669
Yeah.

00:02:32.168 --> 00:02:34.524
yeah

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:38.180
huh ha i see

00:02:39.848 --> 00:02:44.844
on pitches yeah okay no thats what happened yeah okay so

00:02:44.844 --> 00:02:49.282
So he actually has six legs.

00:02:49.282 --> 00:02:52.591
yeah so but he was able to control

00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:56.032
where the jets come from like in the back or to the front

00:02:56.032 --> 00:03:01.028
haahaa yeah so

00:03:01.028 --> 00:03:04.859
Do you think it will be interesting? Let's think.

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.862
Because they've already thrown it out.

00:03:07.862 --> 00:03:12.400
comes out in like um gojira minus one yeah right

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.406
Do you think they're gonna fight with each other?

00:03:15.406 --> 00:03:18.138
(***)

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.573
but you think (***)

00:03:23.573 --> 00:03:28.567
Godzilla will be just as big as Godzilla

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:33.546
Okay, the one from minus one

00:03:34.745 --> 00:03:37.240
(*** )So original size then?

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.903
So Gamera too, right? Gamera is over 50 meters too.

00:03:43.655 --> 00:03:46.758
60 meters. I read it. gamera (***)

00:03:46.758 --> 00:03:51.754
a little taller than the original Godzilla.

00:03:51.754 --> 00:03:54.436
Do you think with what's going on?

00:03:54.436 --> 00:03:58.893
Do you think Godzilla and Gamera, if they fight with each other, that Gamera's gonna win?

00:04:02.097 --> 00:04:04.257
But with a minus one.

00:04:05.963 --> 00:04:10.383
We'll win that one? You think? What about the Shin Godzilla?

00:04:11.936 --> 00:04:16.930
The Gamera too? Because the ?Gamera can fly?

00:04:19.953 --> 00:04:22.838
Because he can basically cut through anything.

00:04:22.838 --> 00:04:27.833
so Do you think Gamera will be more of a hero than Gojira?

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:30.027
if they start fighting each other.

00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:32.920
yeah

00:04:36.523 --> 00:04:39.511
Godzilla can not fly just like Gamera

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:43.121
That's a very big advantage.

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:50.058
yeah That's a very good point.

00:04:50.058 --> 00:04:54.614
I think the author, the one who made Gamera in the first place.

00:04:54.614 --> 00:04:58.479
I really love the turtle. (***)

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.782
But they were looking at the turtle and thought, oh, this can be one of the kaiju.

00:05:02.782 --> 00:05:07.152
and then the kaiju became a good kaiju instead of a bad guy

00:05:10.881 --> 00:05:14.611
Was there a camera made around the time when Gojira was made?

00:05:16.585 --> 00:05:20.854
further answer? yeah yeah oh okay okay but is it from Tuburaya too?

00:05:23.943 --> 00:05:25.326
Maybe.

00:05:30.035 --> 00:05:34.641
For the Gamera. Because Gamera is not as famous as Godzilla.

00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:37.662
so yeah

00:05:37.662 --> 00:05:41.746
You know one thing I really really like about Gamera

00:05:41.746 --> 00:05:45.037
was his teeth. He's too vain.

00:05:45.037 --> 00:05:48.833
like (***)

00:05:48.833 --> 00:05:51.820
and when it closes (***)

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.157
(***)

00:05:56.157 --> 00:06:00.628
(***)

00:06:00.628 --> 00:06:05.236
yeah and then all the movies uhhh when 

00:06:05.236 --> 00:06:09.354
When Gamera was on, Gamera was on his eyelids.

00:06:09.354 --> 00:06:13.015
Yeah, yeah. His eyes are always bright.

00:06:16.348 --> 00:06:18.027
yeah
