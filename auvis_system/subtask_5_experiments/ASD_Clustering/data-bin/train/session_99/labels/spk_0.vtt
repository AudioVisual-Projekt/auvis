WEBVTT

00:00:24.568 --> 00:00:25.257
Yeah.

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:27.207
Hai.

00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:32.854
We're. Were talking about...

00:00:36.128 --> 00:00:41.192
Oh, And then, and then are we on, which team are you on?

00:00:42.248 --> 00:00:45.644
I think we're hobbits like the elves.

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.289
um I think. Yeah, but we talk about once just like

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.804
our eating habits like are we elves

00:00:51.804 --> 00:00:54.798
or human, or dwarf, or hobbit.

00:00:55.786 --> 00:01:00.610
I think. I think, I'm human, like I'm a man.

00:01:02.144 --> 00:01:03.107
Yeah.

00:01:05.353 --> 00:01:08.341
I don't go for 9 meals a week.

00:01:10.855 --> 00:01:11.965
That's true. 

00:01:13.992 --> 00:01:15.117
That's true.

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:24.441
Yeah. Then they grow a little taller.

00:01:25.614 --> 00:01:26.262
mmh

00:01:27.676 --> 00:01:31.138
Hobbiton! No, no question.

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:41.025
I would, that would be my second choice. Yeah.

00:01:53.016 --> 00:01:54.950
Oh, that's true.

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:58.376
Yeah, that's true.

00:02:00.048 --> 00:02:01.445
Yeah. That's true.

00:02:04.962 --> 00:02:05.778
Yeah.

00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:07.557
yeah 

00:02:10.215 --> 00:02:11.100
No...

00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:14.201
I don't think I can do it. Yeah...

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:18.430
Yeah. They like underground. They like underground.

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:19.480
yeah 

00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:22.471
Yeah...

00:02:26.218 --> 00:02:31.148
Weapon? Like kind of weapon or specific weapons?

00:02:31.692 --> 00:02:36.141
Specific weapon used by the characters. Haahh...

00:02:38.493 --> 00:02:40.377
Dwarves actually used it.

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:44.934
Bow and arrow, yeah. I think I would choose that too.

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:49.927
If I had this skill to do anything, I would choose bow and arrow.

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.807
Oh, that's true.

00:02:56.358 --> 00:02:58.416
Oh, that's true.

00:03:00.745 --> 00:03:01.718
Ohhh...

00:03:02.343 --> 00:03:04.012
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.495
Yeah, that's true.

00:03:09.795 --> 00:03:10.408
mmm-hmm

00:03:14.297 --> 00:03:18.398
Yeah, yeah. They went. Yeah.

00:03:23.942 --> 00:03:24.870
Yeah.

00:03:25.773 --> 00:03:26.658
yeah 

00:03:33.028 --> 00:03:36.971
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's my favorite too.

00:03:46.368 --> 00:03:47.531
That's true.

00:03:53.267 --> 00:03:56.685
I feel like Bow and Arrow can be like double duty kind of?

00:03:56.685 --> 00:04:00.178
because you can defend yourself at close range with arrows

00:04:00.178 --> 00:04:02.726
to some extent, and then you can shoot far.

00:04:02.726 --> 00:04:06.946
Like all the other weapons, if you shoot it, you you're done.

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.637
Yeah, yeah, it's just like your arm range.

00:04:11.637 --> 00:04:14.946
Yeah... I think that would be cool.

00:04:19.194 --> 00:04:20.978
Oh, that's true.

00:04:26.588 --> 00:04:32.011
uh... Depends on the axe expert. Yeah, I guess so.

00:04:35.615 --> 00:04:41.189
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah. The catapult!... The catapult.

00:04:44.359 --> 00:04:45.119
Uh-huh.

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:50.383
Oh, the swirling, I mean, crossbow?

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:54.307
Ohhhh...

00:04:59.208 --> 00:05:02.499
Catapult. Oh, battering rams?

00:05:07.122 --> 00:05:10.009
Oh, actually that's true. Battering, it's like

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.523
a really big like piece of metal or wood

00:05:12.523 --> 00:05:16.235
and they ram it against the gate to force it open.

00:05:16.235 --> 00:05:21.233
yeah, yeah... Yeah. someone must...

00:05:23.244 --> 00:05:24.637
A siege tower?

00:05:25.045 --> 00:05:27.806
I guess so, yeah. But look!

00:05:34.463 --> 00:05:35.252
Yeah.

00:05:36.548 --> 00:05:37.733
That's true.

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:47.033
Besides Hobbiton, if you were to choose a

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:50.879
a part of Middle Earth to live in, where would you choose?

00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:58.422
Oh, that's Hobbiton. Oh, Dale?

00:05:58.968 --> 00:05:59.781
Oh.

00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:00.841
Yeah.

00:06:01.345 --> 00:06:02.095
Oh.

00:06:09.915 --> 00:06:10.699
Oh.

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:18.403
Oh. In in Mirkwood?

00:06:21.306 --> 00:06:24.225
No. Never thought the animals.

00:06:24.225 --> 00:06:27.953
I love animals, but that's a lot of mushrooms.

00:06:30.032 --> 00:06:30.670
Oh.
