00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.825
Okay.

00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:40.641
Yes.

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:43.708
Yes, just different themes and colors.

00:00:44.343 --> 00:00:45.904
And I wouldn't of...

00:00:46.023 --> 00:00:50.946
I don't think I would have ever made those connections had I not asked God to sit and watch that show with me.

00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:55.689
And so, not only because I love ninjas, right? I am

00:00:55.808 --> 00:01:00.009
like this fascinated with ninjas, but then to see these different themes.

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:04.273
And they really loved it. Like I, I even like waterfalls.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.695
I even bought the manga for Waterfall, so I'm reading it, yes.

00:01:09.172 --> 00:01:11.939
But... because of that.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.803
It really got me wanting help when I like something.

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:20.433
I want to research the actors, the locations, all that stuff.

00:01:20.394 --> 00:01:23.498
because I love history and I think so

00:01:23.498 --> 00:01:26.029
So I was researching it and I came 

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:30.332
across, there were two YouTube channels that I watched to learn about Japanese culture.

00:01:30.332 --> 00:01:34.095
one of them are, Let's, Let's Ask Shogo.

00:01:34.095 --> 00:01:36.611
And. Have you heard of him before?

00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:41.665
So he is based out of Kyoto, but he lives in Michigan for like six years.

00:01:41.625 --> 00:01:46.122
I think it was like from 6 to 12, he lived in the US in Michigan. And...

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.381
So he talks a lot about...

00:01:49.857 --> 00:01:54.853
different cultural themes, in Kyoto or in general which I love.

00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:59.240
I want to learn about the tea ceremony. I want to learn about...

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.344
He talks about the idols, he talks about like...

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:07.737
Rules how to eat sushi how to eat ramen what not to do like so many different things.

00:02:07.697 --> 00:02:12.118
And then there's another one called the Japanese reporter.

00:02:13.263 --> 00:02:16.819
or Japan reporter and this guy kind of takes like,

00:02:16.847 --> 00:02:19.150
A look at the...

00:02:19.354 --> 00:02:22.594
More darker or controversial side of Japan.

00:02:23.428 --> 00:02:26.544
Yeah, like he'll pick topics that you're like.

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:30.616
It kind of reminds me of this YouTube channel called Soft White Underbelly.

00:02:30.577 --> 00:02:34.187
I don't know if you heard of him. But he um

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:38.473
And he did an interview with the Marine.

00:02:38.473 --> 00:02:41.798
And I just, my heart went out for them.

00:02:42.275 --> 00:02:44.869
I was like, I want to help them.

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:47.097
so bad and

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.449
I was just like telling my family, I want to go to Japan. I think God is calling me there like

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.269
you just like anime that's why you read what you want

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:59.770
I was like okay, so I'll keep praying.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.105
And then he came out with another video right after...

00:03:03.986 --> 00:03:09.656
And I try looking for myself ideally. But it showed this guy who married an anime character

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.792
Have you seen, have you seen a video, so was like  he's an actual doll.

00:03:15.713 --> 00:03:18.518
and he takes the doll with him to the restaurant and

00:03:18.518 --> 00:03:23.379
talks to it, and I'm just like, I I didn't think like

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.733
this guy is a pervert. I didn't think that. I just thought what happened in his life?

00:03:27.733 --> 00:03:30.399
That... Yeah, that made him...

00:03:30.651 --> 00:03:35.173
disconnect from reality and made him feel like this was his only option.

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:40.288
So he goes in the video and he talks about like how he was rejected by three women.

00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:42.095
And I was like...

00:03:42.896 --> 00:03:43.809
Here...

00:03:44.236 --> 00:03:46.918
That happens all the time, right? but

00:03:46.918 --> 00:03:51.913
Then I started to notice the differences in Japanese culture. Right? So, like

00:03:51.913 --> 00:03:52.757
If...

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.305
If

00:03:54.293 --> 00:03:57.703
we don't get into a college or we get fired from a job.

00:03:57.757 --> 00:03:58.591
or

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.546
We don't get a job that we want. It sucks, but it's not a big deal.

00:04:02.546 --> 00:04:06.848
Over there, it's enough to like force them to...

00:04:06.848 --> 00:04:09.598
Not around, um

00:04:09.638 --> 00:04:12.895
if they're getting bullied and I, my heart just went out for them.

00:04:12.856 --> 00:04:16.451
And so, I...  that's when I want to go.

00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:21.028
I want to go to Japan so I can, because to me the only...

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.028
the only thing that

00:04:24.028 --> 00:04:28.736
can steal whatever hurt they have and to restore that confidence

00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:33.274
in. Is Jesus to restore that confidence in him and to heal their hurt.

00:04:33.592 --> 00:04:36.380
And because it's not like...

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.969
A lot of people don't know. It's not like here, there's a church every corner.

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:45.070
There's, you know, so many resources. They don't have that in Japan.

00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:49.503
So I just really felt like the calling to go and I want to serve there, 

00:04:49.543 --> 00:04:51.478
hikikomori families.

00:04:52.074 --> 00:04:57.143
Oh, that's- Naruto is very special to me. It's not just an anime, it like changed my whole life.

00:04:58.981 --> 00:04:59.776
Yup.

00:05:05.483 --> 00:05:06.317
Yes.

00:05:11.475 --> 00:05:12.436
Yeah.

00:05:16.728 --> 00:05:17.572
Yeah.

00:05:40.774 --> 00:05:41.687
Yeah.

00:05:53.757 --> 00:05:54.551
Yeah.

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:58.453
Yup.

00:05:58.668 --> 00:05:59.502
Yup.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.781
It doesn't hit. It doesn't hit the same.

00:06:15.622 --> 00:06:18.373
That's what I think it's like such a

00:06:18.777 --> 00:06:20.870
such a dangerous coz

00:06:21.173 --> 00:06:25.865
When we're tired, if we're not feeling good, like emotionally.

00:06:25.865 --> 00:06:30.741
and we're isolated, Oh man Satan was heard...
