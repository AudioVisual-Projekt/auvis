WEBVTT

00:00:13.558 --> 00:00:16.003
Okay. So favorite romance?

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:21.064
I guess the one that I'm most um... familiar with is the story between

00:00:21.064 --> 00:00:26.217
Aragorn and... Yeah, that's probably the most I'm most familiar with.

00:00:26.771 --> 00:00:29.704
But I guess. It's like, if you say like a favorite.

00:00:29.704 --> 00:00:31.325
Um... I'm not sure.

00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:33.899
Yeah. 

00:00:43.974 --> 00:00:45.400
Favorite scene.

00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:46.391
Yeah. 

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:50.824
Yeah. 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.042
Some of them has millions. Yeah.

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:57.873
Yeah. I don't want to read some of it.

00:00:58.743 --> 00:01:02.846
There's an eternal um... eternal um, thing of a...

00:01:02.846 --> 00:01:07.132
There's an eternal lift of romances in it. Yeah.

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:17.509
Yeah, I know. You like that story a lot.

00:01:19.096 --> 00:01:21.965
Is that Merry?  No, I'm okay.

00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:26.455
I'm okay. I'll, I'll just stick to Faramir defeating everybody.

00:01:27.048 --> 00:01:29.587
But then in the end, yeah. Yeah.

00:01:30.538 --> 00:01:32.090
Yeah, everyday.

00:01:34.268 --> 00:01:39.229
No, you didn't make me, but I was like, I'm okay with it. I mean like, but I'm not too interested in those.

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.758
Except big creatures destroying everything.

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:44.536
Yeah, the black dragon that's what I heard

00:01:47.268 --> 00:01:49.556
Wait. Can you read it? Okay.

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:54.670
Okay. But anyway back to Lord of the Rings. But I like I like Faramir. Yeah, yeah.

00:02:09.012 --> 00:02:11.798
They kind of did. They did.

00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:14.195
Yeah. 

00:02:16.416 --> 00:02:17.089
Yeah. 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.183
Yeah. 

00:02:25.302 --> 00:02:25.975
Yeah. 

00:02:29.605 --> 00:02:30.668
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:35.431
Yeah. 

00:02:39.101 --> 00:02:41.177
Yeah, but like, yeah, that's good though.

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:43.031
Yeah. 

00:02:44.602 --> 00:02:48.989
Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're like, they're like more, they're like dozens of them.

00:02:51.694 --> 00:02:52.956
coz another further.

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:55.639
Yeah. 

00:02:55.897 --> 00:02:56.728
Yeah. 

00:02:57.697 --> 00:02:59.470
And they do the Goldilocks.

00:03:07.096 --> 00:03:09.342
Yeah, one of those, one of those wizards.

00:03:11.181 --> 00:03:15.147
I like family trees. I like family trees in Lord of the Rings. Those are good.

00:03:17.557 --> 00:03:18.428
Yeah. 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.660
But then like, most of their names are either not mentioned or mentioned once.

00:03:23.391 --> 00:03:24.103
Yeah. 

00:03:29.578 --> 00:03:30.369
Yeah. 

00:03:31.093 --> 00:03:32.920
He made the language. Yeah.

00:03:36.895 --> 00:03:37.687
Yeah. 

00:03:39.643 --> 00:03:40.593
Elvish.

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:43.514
That change of.

00:03:45.766 --> 00:03:47.175
Which Elvish?

00:03:50.662 --> 00:03:51.414
Pin.

00:03:53.402 --> 00:03:55.519
Which Elvish is it? Which is, what the name?

00:03:59.362 --> 00:04:00.194
Yeah. 

00:04:05.063 --> 00:04:10.928
I guess Doldrums are good. I guess it's kind of like, Japanese is kind of like elvish to some people.

00:04:11.943 --> 00:04:12.735
Yeah. 

00:04:13.618 --> 00:04:16.166
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.663
Yeah. 

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.428
Yeah.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:27.674
What if you could only talk to older people and whatever you say became a spell?

00:04:27.674 --> 00:04:31.219
So like, when you talk, something happens somewhere. So...

00:04:36.245 --> 00:04:36.997
yeah 

00:04:37.058 --> 00:04:38.150
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:38.746 --> 00:04:39.537
Yeah.

00:04:42.205 --> 00:04:44.702
Yeah, but if you don't know, yeah. Hey look

00:04:44.702 --> 00:04:49.697
the entire world just blew up. Also, I think I spoke the wrong word in that language.

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:52.758
Wait, how do you do?

00:04:52.877 --> 00:04:55.076
It looks like a waterfall.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.645
Yeah, maybe not the older one. I guess the newer one might be better. Newer Elvish.

00:05:03.957 --> 00:05:06.642
Oh. Sindarin and Quenya.

00:05:08.108 --> 00:05:10.173
Sindarin. Yeah. Sindarin.

00:05:14.412 --> 00:05:16.173
Sisinda- Sindarin.

00:05:16.173 --> 00:05:20.291
And then, I can just imagine dictionaries saying, Sindarin, new revised.

00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:21.672
Translation.

00:05:26.622 --> 00:05:27.493
Yup.

00:05:29.578 --> 00:05:30.607
Yeah.

00:05:30.618 --> 00:05:35.596
No, you can actually make a really simple, like language. Like, new language by, like, just, like

00:05:35.596 --> 00:05:38.472
making new letters for English words.

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:41.761
Yeah.

00:05:45.057 --> 00:05:46.161
Oh, really?

00:05:52.318 --> 00:05:53.070
Yeah.

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:03.538
Oh.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.722
To make... to like the Elvish. 

00:06:13.266 --> 00:06:14.173
Woah.
