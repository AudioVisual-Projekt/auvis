WEBVTT

00:00:09.354 --> 00:00:10.534
Too much.

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:15.190
Uh...

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:17.891
Favorite romance.

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:24.117
Arwen. Yeah.

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.204
Oh.

00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:27.224
That's good.

00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:31.335
Oh.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.501
But that's the one you know most?

00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:44.435
Well, I think Faramir and Eowyn. Aragorn

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:46.679
and Arwen.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.170
Um... I guess there's little. Um... maybe there was Samwise.  I think, I was thinking

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.173
Celebrian. So many!

00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:56.582
So many.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:59.023
Yeah, that's true.

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:04.677
Huh.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.927
Yeah. That's true.

00:01:08.703 --> 00:01:11.537
I think, well, I really, from this film, really,

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:15.861
moving away from lord of the rings but i think I like Luthien and Beren.

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:17.343
I know.

00:01:19.073 --> 00:01:21.923
Uh... Silmarillion, I think...

00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:25.543
What did they

00:01:27.322 --> 00:01:28.632
I think they

00:01:28.632 --> 00:01:32.007
Did we listen to their in the movie yesterday? Okay.

00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:34.459
I think I made you listen to them.

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:36.109
Oh.

00:01:36.868 --> 00:01:37.903
Okay.

00:01:38.774 --> 00:01:43.328
Yeah. Oh, There's a lot of big creatures. Yeah.

00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:48.143
Oh, the black dragon was so sad I didn't read enough story. 

00:01:48.736 --> 00:01:50.329
Okay, I'll read it.

00:01:52.138 --> 00:01:54.412
Wait, you said it's a ...

00:01:56.852 --> 00:01:57.602
Uh-huh.

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.890
Uh-huh.

00:02:04.305 --> 00:02:05.268
Yeah.

00:02:08.302 --> 00:02:09.093
Oh.

00:02:10.027 --> 00:02:13.299
I think like, It comes up like near the 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.535
end, and then like Sam is like he's always been

00:02:17.535 --> 00:02:21.636
And they've like, they've like, did like each other, they've loved each other.

00:02:21.636 --> 00:02:24.742
But then he made her wait because he went on the journey.

00:02:24.742 --> 00:02:27.982
And then when he came back, she's like, are we gonna wait anymore?

00:02:27.982 --> 00:02:31.440
And then they kinda... So, they didn't go into it too 

00:02:31.322 --> 00:02:34.264
much, but then they show that it's always there. 

00:02:37.195 --> 00:02:39.506
Yeah..... yeah.

00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:41.226
Yeah.

00:02:41.548 --> 00:02:42.339
Yeah.

00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:43.862
They have so many kids.

00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:46.128
They have so many.

00:02:48.146 --> 00:02:49.055
Yeah...

00:02:49.194 --> 00:02:54.189
There's like Frodo and... There's like another Frodo.

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.487
And a Pippin, and a Merry.

00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:01.680
They made uh... there's a Goldilocks um...

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:03.072
Wait. Somebody

00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:05.669
named their son Faramir though.

00:03:05.672 --> 00:03:08.083
Pippin? I don't remember.

00:03:15.388 --> 00:03:16.968
It's so complex.

00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:25.074
That's true. Yeah.

00:03:28.934 --> 00:03:32.865
yeah he made the whole thing he made the languages

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:35.849
Oh...

00:03:37.168 --> 00:03:41.505
Oh, if you could learn the language...of one of

00:03:41.505 --> 00:03:45.708
Oh yeah, Elvish, which Elvish?

00:03:46.695 --> 00:03:50.398
Like Quenya or like like the really

00:03:50.398 --> 00:03:53.285
old old Elvish, or the new

00:03:53.285 --> 00:03:56.069
Elvish. Like the old, old

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.208
Elvish is like where what all the spells are written 

00:03:59.208 --> 00:04:03.612
in. And then the new word of it is what the regular people talk about.

00:04:03.612 --> 00:04:06.443
Oh, the old one? Oh...

00:04:11.132 --> 00:04:15.290
Oh, kind me. Like, oh there's a really older kind and a new one.

00:04:18.095 --> 00:04:20.285
I think I would choose the newer kind.

00:04:20.285 --> 00:04:21.718
so like... Yeah...

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:25.119
can talk the Elvish.

00:04:35.725 --> 00:04:37.449
Oh, that's true.

00:04:37.984 --> 00:04:38.893
Yeah.

00:04:38.915 --> 00:04:44.246
That's true. Say something in a certain language and then you don't know what's gonna happen.

00:04:51.293 --> 00:04:52.636
That could be...

00:04:56.157 --> 00:04:57.934
That could be true.

00:05:00.564 --> 00:05:04.497
Yeah. Me too. Oh, Sindarin. Yeah, yeah.

00:05:05.444 --> 00:05:08.782
I think the old one is Quenya and the new one is Sindarin.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.465
I don't think I'm pronouncing it. It sounds like Mandarin.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.468
Yeah...

00:05:25.543 --> 00:05:26.412
Yeah.

00:05:26.333 --> 00:05:30.062
His like, his mind for language it's like fascinating.

00:05:38.627 --> 00:05:39.338
Yes.

00:05:41.036 --> 00:05:41.787
Uh-huh.

00:05:42.105 --> 00:05:42.935
Uh-huh.

00:05:44.684 --> 00:05:46.778
Oh... Really?

00:05:47.785 --> 00:05:48.574
Uh-huh.

00:05:51.239 --> 00:05:52.306
Huh...

00:05:57.872 --> 00:05:59.204
Oh, not bad.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.658
Uh-huh.

00:06:01.754 --> 00:06:02.545
Uh-huh.

00:06:02.764 --> 00:06:04.661
Yeahhh...

00:06:05.686 --> 00:06:10.646
Uh-huh. To, to part... make sure it's accurate.
