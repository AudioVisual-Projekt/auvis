WEBVTT

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.274
Where are we?... About...

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:19.859
Yeah like, and she likes Mexi. Yeah, Patricia.

00:00:25.022 --> 00:00:26.134
Oh...

00:00:27.257 --> 00:00:30.013
You like avocado? Uh-huh?

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.174
Yeah. How about you?

00:00:42.936 --> 00:00:43.937
Which one?

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:46.923
American Food.

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:49.802
Hamburger and barbecue.

00:00:53.315 --> 00:00:54.531
Yeah.

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:01.132
Mexican.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.124
Yeah. 

00:01:04.622 --> 00:01:07.408
Chimichanga. What is chimichanga?

00:01:09.634 --> 00:01:13.330
Oh, She can take a burrito and fry it. Wow, very healthy.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:19.486
Is that. is that true Mexican or is it American- Mexican?

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:24.608
Yeah. 

00:01:26.558 --> 00:01:27.630
Oh...

00:01:27.606 --> 00:01:32.600
But in the end, East Coast Mexican food is not that great.

00:01:33.196 --> 00:01:36.955
Yeah, their influence is more the Spanish people.

00:01:36.955 --> 00:01:40.937
There are a lot more Puerto Ricans over there than Mexico because of...

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:44.638
logistically yeah... but...

00:01:50.657 --> 00:01:52.082
Yeah.... 

00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:55.854
Dubai. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:55.854 --> 00:01:59.466
Yeah... Um, I like...

00:02:00.617 --> 00:02:03.907
I like Mexican food but I think 

00:02:04.106 --> 00:02:08.544
After Asian food, I- I still like my meat, so I would say...

00:02:08.544 --> 00:02:12.797
Steak and... Yeah... Steak and barbecue.

00:02:12.797 --> 00:02:13.809
Yeah.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.939
Lucille. Yeah... ribs.

00:02:19.337 --> 00:02:22.815
Yeah. Yeah. Once in a while...

00:02:22.974 --> 00:02:25.488
But, Steak and

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:27.882
At the end of the day, I don't...

00:02:27.882 --> 00:02:31.714
Go often because is it's, it could get expensive.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.927
But...

00:02:33.456 --> 00:02:34.210
it...

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:39.044
It's something you can't eat all the time so it's like yeah.

00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:42.017
Yeah. Like...

00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:47.609
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.850
And in between all of the Asian food I have.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.845
the next thing I go for a steak and then I go back to my Asian food

00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.110
Um...

00:03:01.566 --> 00:03:03.495
It depends on my mood.

00:03:04.131 --> 00:03:07.523
Um. But around here a...

00:03:07.523 --> 00:03:12.179
The San Franciscan prime hou, um prime ribs is really popular.

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:16.685
in the Sear um, in Torrance area so um, I end up

00:03:16.685 --> 00:03:19.722
Going there, so I end up getting like prime rib

00:03:19.722 --> 00:03:22.568
more often than not yeah

00:03:25.775 --> 00:03:28.870
I like, I like medium. Yeah.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.864
I used to like rare, but lately I'm like no, I'll have it cooked.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.522
Okay, I have a question. Do you... When you eat steak, steak. Do you like...

00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:44.012
Wagyu steak or American steak?

00:03:47.954 --> 00:03:52.498
Like Wagyu is very marbleized and it's very fatty.

00:03:52.697 --> 00:03:55.852
But it's really soft because it's fatty.

00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:59.733
But American like fillet like they like to keep their back

00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:04.063
Collected on one side and then it's just the meat is meat.

00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:09.000
Okay.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.038
Yeah, okay. Yeah, like I'm- I'm not a big fan of Wagyu like

00:04:19.515 --> 00:04:22.953
I feel like a lot of people are like, oh, this is great, but

00:04:23.549 --> 00:04:26.328
After eating it, I feel like there's a lot of...

00:04:26.328 --> 00:04:29.690
fat left over in my mouth

00:04:30.087 --> 00:04:33.162
So it gets like, wow, I would eat a...

00:04:33.162 --> 00:04:38.090
It feels like to me like wow I'm just eating a stick of butter

00:04:38.567 --> 00:04:40.337
Yeah, that...

00:04:40.644 --> 00:04:42.669
Yeah, meat flavor fat.

00:04:44.665 --> 00:04:47.422
But at the same time I probably have not had like the

00:04:47.422 --> 00:04:49.738
Really top-notch one...

00:04:49.936 --> 00:04:53.446
Yeah, wagyu like it because it's expensive so

00:04:53.446 --> 00:04:55.849
maybe I'm only eating the fake ones.

00:04:59.778 --> 00:05:02.778
Um... I don't like anything. I like it just salt and pepper.

00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:08.488
Just straight. Like I don't like any sauce. I don't nis. I want my meat.

00:05:13.391 --> 00:05:15.178
Oh, yeah.

00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:17.265
Tok.

00:05:22.253 --> 00:05:25.958
Do you... What do you like with your steak?

00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:33.699
Yeah... Yeah. Oh, oh...

00:05:33.818 --> 00:05:36.477
