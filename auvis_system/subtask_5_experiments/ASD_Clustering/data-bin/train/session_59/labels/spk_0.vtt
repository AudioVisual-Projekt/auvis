That's what I'm gonna say.

00:01:19.014 --> 00:01:20.250

Oh.

00:01:39.124 --> 00:01:42.193
Oh, I see. That makes sense. That makes sense.

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:46.334
Yeah. But I think, I think Americans are good at taking the...

00:01:46.334 --> 00:01:50.686
Mexican food into American eyes making it more unhealthy.

00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:55.146
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:57.019 --> 00:01:59.428
Yachan maybe you need...

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.493
Um... like um... Lu Lucille?

00:02:17.973 --> 00:02:22.252
Yeah, I like that too. Once in a while.

00:02:28.943 --> 00:02:32.301
Yeah... Yeah, that's true

00:02:37.063 --> 00:02:38.088
Yeah.

00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:44.087
Eh, and then you can't really cook it at out.

00:02:45.075 --> 00:02:45.832
Yeah. 

00:02:56.348 --> 00:03:00.234
Do you like the... like barbecue ribs or steak more?

00:03:22.165 --> 00:03:26.688
Do you get like medium or medium rare or well done.

00:03:34.806 --> 00:03:36.865
Let them work a little more.

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.680
What's the difference? I don't really know.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.497

On the side? Yeah.

00:04:03.836 --> 00:04:06.818
I don't think I had that much Wagyu.

00:04:07.431 --> 00:04:09.026
Yeah... Yeah.

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:15.619
But just hearing it, I think I would like the American one and get the, get rid of the panning part. Yeah.

00:04:26.437 --> 00:04:27.394
Really?

00:04:38.324 --> 00:04:39.339

Yeah, Yeah.

00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:19.312

00:05:22.861 --> 00:05:23.768
Yeah.

00:05:30.028 --> 00:05:33.420
