WEBVTT

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:17.125
We're talking about the depth of Leoland.

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:22.120
Ha.. ha.. ha..   Movie  Koreans   Yeah, that's true.

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:24.786
Hmm...

00:00:34.928 --> 00:00:38.354
 OKay...    gandalf>>   Yeah...

00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:42.083
Oh, it's the Wings of Power. That's so gross.

00:00:43.422 --> 00:00:45.008
It's   True...

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:00.489
Her name...

00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:06.248
Galateria ... Laglass..    I thing  Galateria  is a lot...

00:01:06.203 --> 00:01:11.198
Yeah...    She's 18.

00:01:11.242 --> 00:01:15.074
I don't know like I don't think Tolkien wrote

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:19.833
when he was born? I think Woodland King is really old.

00:01:20.786 --> 00:01:25.781
 Galadriel is super old  too...   Yeah.. He could be really old too...

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.902
I shan't.

00:01:27.465 --> 00:01:29.468
Ha, ha, ha...

00:01:29.637 --> 00:01:34.361
It could be. It could be, yeah.

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:36.875
Yeah, she's like

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:41.077
three very original elves in Middle-earth

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:45.556
And then I think she's like his daughter.

00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:49.009
She's like second generation else...

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.625
In the world...  Ha..  ha..  ha.. 

00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:56.619
Kind of. Or granddaughter? Or something like that. No, no, no, she's granddaughter.. Yeah..

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.792
Anyway. Ha..  ha..  ha...   Hmmm

00:01:59.695 --> 00:02:00.488
So...

00:02:05.043 --> 00:02:06.232
Ah  huh...

00:02:08.702 --> 00:02:11.723
Ha.. ha.. ha.. Oh, Brandon Cass! He's cute!

00:02:11.723 --> 00:02:15.215
He  bring the differy........

00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:18.995
That's true. He only shows up a little bit in the third movie.

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:20.647
Yeah...

00:02:20.648 --> 00:02:23.708
And they attack and though ... (***)

00:02:23.957 --> 00:02:27.957
And then he comes in with his rabbit and then takes Gandalf out.

00:02:27.957 --> 00:02:31.618
Yeah..   Yeah..    He comes at the very end riding the eagle

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:34.133
She brings the eagles

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:38.926
Yeah...  (***)

00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:42.368
Ha.. ha.. ha..  Bail one...  Ohh.. Bail one...

00:02:42.368 --> 00:02:46.654
Baeone. ..    Baeone...

00:02:47.047 --> 00:02:48.742
Ha, ha, ha...

00:02:49.097 --> 00:02:53.113
Ha..  ha...  ha..  I thought it was Baeone, but it was Baeone..

00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:56.846
But Baeone sounds better than Beorn. Anyway... ha..  ha.. 

00:02:59.868 --> 00:03:02.568
Ahh  hum. ...Yeah yeah yeah

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.081
Yeah... Oh, the beast, the tiger  beast.

00:03:09.081 --> 00:03:13.992
Au  hung.. Yeah..  That's actually something specified in the book(***).

00:03:13.992 --> 00:03:18.616
humongous idea yeah it actually comes in world

00:03:18.616 --> 00:03:20.675
I know sing a song... 

00:03:22.396 --> 00:03:26.917
No, that's..No I know..thats not from the book because in the book..

00:03:26.917 --> 00:03:31.610
His descendants are still there in the Lord of the Rings.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.980
But then in the movie they said he's the last one.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.417
Yeah.. That's true...  and his connect...

00:03:40.395 --> 00:03:43.956
and his motor for helping the dwarves.

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:48.552
I wouldn't be there otherwise. Yeah.. Yuuu...

00:03:54.727 --> 00:03:57.867
I don't like dwarves,...

00:03:57.867 --> 00:04:02.795
But orcs I hate more.. ha.. ha.. ha.. ha.. Yeah...

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:05.419
Yeah.....     Yeah...

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.250
Yeah...

00:04:11.281 --> 00:04:13.219
Yeah...

00:04:16.345 --> 00:04:17.996
Yeah...

00:04:19.702 --> 00:04:21.862
Yeah, yeah... yeah.. ha... ha.. ha..  yeah...

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.305
Yeah..   yeah...  yeah...     Yeah...  And then he has information that even Gandalf wants.

00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:36.106
Like in the.. In

00:04:36.106 --> 00:04:41.101
In  the ...   In the not cut version... Cycle

00:04:41.104 --> 00:04:45.375
Am.. like in  in  the un cat versi....n

00:04:45.617 --> 00:04:48.402
Like, we are in talks about the dead walking?

00:04:48.402 --> 00:04:51.473
And the Gandalf didn't know about that.

00:04:51.495 --> 00:04:55.782
And so that's part of what gets Yanda to go to check out those tombs.

00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:02.296
The dead walking with the Nazgul.

00:05:02.296 --> 00:05:05.721
Yeah... So he knew about the Naskell.

00:05:05.721 --> 00:05:10.041
Rumors about them and then Gandalf did it

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:15.013
And so that's what led Gandalf to realize that this was Sauron.

00:05:15.036 --> 00:05:18.275
Yeah .. yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah....

00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:21.336
Yeah, yeah, yeah.. yeah...

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.157
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Wasn't there. Yeah, none of them were there.

00:05:26.157 --> 00:05:29.885
 Well yeah well all the tools were open

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:38.120
The  true..They were not locked up.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.075
Well, that's what they did. Yeah.

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:49.877
Well..Yeah, well they were buried there... Yeah.. (***)

00:05:53.258 --> 00:05:57.089
Yeah, because they all broke up because they were called.

00:05:57.392 --> 00:06:01.966
Yeah...  It's really interesting. In the movie...

00:06:01.966 --> 00:06:04.496
They did like all the Nazgul died. 

00:06:04.496 --> 00:06:08.226
So they're ghosts basically, but in the book they never died.

00:06:08.226 --> 00:06:12.950
They're just people who faded from being regular people

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.279
to basically...
