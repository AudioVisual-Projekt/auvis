WEBVTT

00:00:11.562 --> 00:00:13.603
Okay, stop moving.

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:26.355
Okay, food.

00:00:28.198 --> 00:00:29.045
Okay.

00:00:32.476 --> 00:00:34.622
My favorite food.

00:00:35.186 --> 00:00:39.271
Oh gosh, I, it depends on my mood but the ones that...

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:44.265
I like Japanese food the most and of that I think

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:48.585
Sushi is probably the top like

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:53.512
It's a special treat, I guess. Oh yeah, at home we do 

00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:56.077
Like the...um...

00:00:56.583 --> 00:00:59.098
The roll thing with the handle and then we would

00:00:59.098 --> 00:01:02.997
buy all the, the raw fish, the sashimi.

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:06.453
and we slice it up and put it in the middle and then we have our own dish.

00:01:06.573 --> 00:01:11.569
Rice and then you give us a seat and you get to choose your own top. 

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:14.135
Like, whatever you want to put into your hand roll.

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:18.353
So I like that. I love that home family style like you just

00:01:18.353 --> 00:01:19.906
have all the fish.

00:01:21.036 --> 00:01:25.965
Oh you could do it a cone or you could wrap it and then like we have other stuff other than fish.

00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:30.959
like tuna, salmon... Yeah. So...

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.185
cheap. Yeah...

00:01:34.856 --> 00:01:38.105
What's everybody else's favorite food?

00:01:41.018 --> 00:01:42.753
Ohhhh...

00:01:45.807 --> 00:01:46.646
Yeah.

00:01:49.218 --> 00:01:50.826
Donburi's Pho.

00:02:07.582 --> 00:02:08.229
yeah 

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:34.290
Yeah. Northern Japan has good seafood.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.665
Like, yeah, they say the colder the water,

00:02:37.665 --> 00:02:41.987
um... the seafood is a lot to tastes better.

00:02:42.108 --> 00:02:45.480
And so if you like go to Hokkaido, it's known for...

00:02:57.415 --> 00:02:58.425
Yeah. 

00:02:58.421 --> 00:03:01.612
I think like, um... like

00:03:01.612 --> 00:03:04.548
mainland in asia and

00:03:04.548 --> 00:03:08.125
in Russia area, it's it's cold.

00:03:08.085 --> 00:03:10.954
But it's very dry, so you're not going to get that.

00:03:10.993 --> 00:03:15.855
snowfall but Japan is has enough moisture

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:18.081
Yeah.

00:03:19.094 --> 00:03:20.215
Yeah.

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:22.484
And I, I believe that.

00:03:30.838 --> 00:03:32.527
Oh, really? Which part?

00:03:32.881 --> 00:03:35.099
Asahikawa. Wow.

00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:37.993

Yeah. 

00:04:47.603 --> 00:04:51.793

00:04:51.632 --> 00:04:52.844
Close. What is it?

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.565
