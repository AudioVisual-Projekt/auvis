00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:00.896
mmh

00:01:17.904 --> 00:01:18.577
Oh.

00:01:53.678 --> 00:01:54.391
mmh

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:02.592
Oh.

00:02:03.011 --> 00:02:04.241
That's good thing.

00:02:19.893 --> 00:02:20.527
mmh

00:02:23.086 --> 00:02:23.760
mmh

00:02:23.885 --> 00:02:24.660
That's so true.

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:30.497
Yeah. 

00:02:34.886 --> 00:02:37.115
They they think that's the time.

00:02:57.774 --> 00:02:58.448
Yeah. 

00:03:07.965 --> 00:03:09.280
Performance.

00:03:15.318 --> 00:03:15.952
Oh.

00:03:24.681 --> 00:03:25.553
Oh...

00:03:33.795 --> 00:03:34.627
mmh

00:03:39.974 --> 00:03:44.810
What's that one thing that they, that no one does now that they did?

00:03:51.676 --> 00:03:52.389
mmh

00:03:54.638 --> 00:03:57.506
Like It was more like rustic or raw?

00:03:59.485 --> 00:04:00.159
mmh

00:04:07.968 --> 00:04:08.760
mmh

00:04:20.058 --> 00:04:20.732
Right.

00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:26.379
Okay.

00:04:28.311 --> 00:04:29.103
mmh

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:36.386
So it's more about getting the gritty, real, raw

00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:37.740
emotion.

00:04:42.413 --> 00:04:43.205
Ooh.

00:04:46.124 --> 00:04:47.112
Okay.

00:05:08.432 --> 00:05:09.586
Aww.

00:05:25.916 --> 00:05:27.610
They're like A minor 7. 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.355
I like the heavenly sounding chords like

00:05:49.355 --> 00:05:51.671
krrring. The happy, you know.

00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:01.386
Oh.

00:06:17.874 --> 00:06:22.834
Wait, you're doing this. What is this? Like, which instrument is this? Piano? Okay.
