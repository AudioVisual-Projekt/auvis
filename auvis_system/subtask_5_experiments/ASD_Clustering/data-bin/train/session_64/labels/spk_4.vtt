00:00:33.743 --> 00:00:35.289
yeah

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:40.274
A real life one? Well, he's nice. But like, I kinda...

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:43.227
Like that is Irena's book.

00:00:43.227 --> 00:00:48.221
I like the guy who is trying to escape on the helicopter.

00:00:48.221 --> 00:00:50.803
Yeah, that guy in the animation

00:00:50.803 --> 00:00:53.622
Yeah, yeah, yeah but (***)

00:00:53.622 --> 00:00:58.616
But who's your favorite character? The human character? The animated one?

00:00:58.616 --> 00:00:58.752
you

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:02.328
yeah

00:01:05.957 --> 00:01:07.865
Oh, which 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.036

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.107
ahh

00:01:17.532 --> 00:01:19.156
yeah

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.723
You're talking about the line action, I'm talking about the animation

00:01:24.723 --> 00:01:27.523
Yeah, don't let it be me. Don't let it be you.

00:01:27.523 --> 00:01:30.038
A little bit.

00:01:30.038 --> 00:01:34.746
baby Gomera who's like flying around

00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:39.199

00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:43.353
yeah yeah yeah

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:48.348
yeah yeah

00:01:48.348 --> 00:01:50.693
Yeah, yeah, yeah

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:53.281

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.642
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:57.425 --> 00:01:59.924
Oh, because he needs to grow.

00:01:59.924 --> 00:02:03.062
yeah and then to fight the monster

00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:10.538
yeah i think it was very sensing really yeah i think so

00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:12.698
Not really, but I think that will happen

00:02:16.294 --> 00:02:17.657
yeah

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.714
yeah

00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:30.704
Maybe not, but he needs to protect the people.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.581
(***) Yeah.

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:44.086
I'm actually not sure, but usually in the Gamera movies, the kids help the Gamera out.

00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:48.288
Remember that.

00:02:48.288 --> 00:02:51.392

00:02:51.392 --> 00:02:56.151
like they said like help the little turtle yeah

00:02:58.092 --> 00:03:02.598
At the beginning, remember? They found this turtle and then they helped it out.

00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:06.698
yeah yeah

00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:12.014
I think so. yeah

00:03:17.836 --> 00:03:20.384
maybe but i think yeah i think i'm

00:03:20.384 --> 00:03:24.603
I'm gonna protect him because he's like the chosen one or something

00:03:24.603 --> 00:03:29.598
Yeah, I don't really get it. Yeah.

00:03:29.598 --> 00:03:29.986
yeah

00:03:32.652 --> 00:03:35.790
So all those monsters were after him?

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.785
Because (***) that boy...

00:03:40.785 --> 00:03:42.254
Yeah, yeah. Empower.

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.649
Kind of. But then they... yeah

00:03:50.557 --> 00:03:52.338

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.932
(***) Which one?

00:04:13.397 --> 00:04:15.710
(***)

00:04:16.561 --> 00:04:18.635
i thought

00:04:19.928 --> 00:04:21.814
yeah

00:04:23.317 --> 00:04:26.540
(***) work together

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.605
They didn't come in the same episode. (***)

00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:35.612
No, I don't.

00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:38.750
yeah

00:04:39.054 --> 00:04:40.417

00:04:40.708 --> 00:04:45.704
They're always trying to get the kid. Yeah, Gamma is protecting the kid.

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:54.006
My time can begin. yeah

00:04:54.296 --> 00:04:56.131
but then

00:04:56.605 --> 00:05:01.600

00:05:04.087 --> 00:05:07.231
yeah yeah (***)

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.653
