WEBVTT

00:00:22.142 --> 00:00:25.703
Okay, so topic on the gum it out.

00:00:25.703 --> 00:00:30.260
Other things that you like, what do you think about the boy that came out of the camera?

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.804
No, not the animation.

00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:36.689
The real person one.

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:39.406
yeah yeah

00:00:48.637 --> 00:00:53.007
oh the (***) We like the boy better.

00:00:57.596 --> 00:01:00.668
A human character? Actually, I like...

00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:06.641
Those two other boys who's a friend with the main character.

00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:09.680
They are brothers.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.987
you know the young older brother and younger brother

00:01:12.987 --> 00:01:16.126
who came and wanted to see.

00:01:16.126 --> 00:01:20.833
They were the ones that the main characters shared the secret of the Gamera.

00:01:22.795 --> 00:01:26.450
(***) that's why

00:01:28.056 --> 00:01:31.870
I like the younger brother than the older brother.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.814
yeah yeah that was a kind of little joke i like i like that girl too who's a neighbor

00:01:36.814 --> 00:01:39.329
Who's her neighbor?

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.907
Yeah, but she was kind of funny too.

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:46.871
but funny thing about that movie is everybody

00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:49.841
it was able to keep the secret yeah 

00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:53.689
Well, until the camera ran away or took off.

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.684
Why do you think he took off from the shed?

00:01:58.684 --> 00:02:02.094
They need to grow and it was too little

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.966
Oh, do you think he was already sensing the... Really?

00:02:08.388 --> 00:02:10.851
Was there any scene that indicates that?

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.103
Okay, okay.

00:02:15.643 --> 00:02:19.119
So the little...

00:02:20.268 --> 00:02:22.850
Yeah, so do you think

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.258
He was already ready to fight with the monster.

00:02:30.106 --> 00:02:35.017
So my question is why the Godzilla, Gamera, compared to Godzilla?

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:38.931
likes to protect people when Godzilla just want to destroy them all.

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.601
So that's interesting.

00:02:50.814 --> 00:02:52.491
mm mm

00:02:54.608 --> 00:02:58.405
Yeah. Helped a little turtle at the end.

00:03:03.535 --> 00:03:07.888
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The very beginning of the movie.

00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:12.665
And then that was the Gamera, supposedly.

00:03:12.665 --> 00:03:17.660
so but so it was kind of one of those like returning the favor you think for the gamera

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.836
That's a little too much

00:03:24.966 --> 00:03:29.101
That was kind of a little weird. Like he was chosen one for, I don't know.

00:03:29.101 --> 00:03:33.673
But that was kind of one of those storylines.

00:03:36.584 --> 00:03:38.123
yeah

00:03:38.854 --> 00:03:41.419
Because that will actually give the power.

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.689
So it was kind of like one of those titans.

00:03:47.596 --> 00:03:51.763
So they kind of be the strongest ones.

00:03:53.047 --> 00:03:57.602
But the monsters, they did fight together to fight against Godzilla.

00:03:59.627 --> 00:04:04.167
Because at the last scene, there's two...

00:04:04.167 --> 00:04:06.681
Kaiju, I think the monsters came out.

00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:10.461
and then fight against Godzilla, I mean, Gamera I think.

00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:15.524
How was it? The last one who came out...

00:04:17.818 --> 00:04:22.138
It's Gels and uh... the 

00:04:22.138 --> 00:04:23.590
The squid one.

00:04:25.446 --> 00:04:30.323
Well, maybe they weren't really working together but they were...

00:04:30.323 --> 00:04:32.989
 Same episode?

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:37.580
They're not? Okay, maybe. I thought they were.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.540
but it looks like they're constantly attacking

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.915
Yeah, got that idea.

00:04:45.915 --> 00:04:48.429
yeah yeah yeah but so

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:52.852
The monsters basically were not really attacking Gamera, they were attacking the boy.

00:04:52.852 --> 00:04:57.830
yeah so that's an agave that was protected

00:05:02.706 --> 00:05:06.470
So that's why they eat people and they destroy people.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.984
 Okay, okay. Yeah.

00:05:08.984 --> 00:05:12.443
That's why Gabera was there standing in the way.

00:05:12.443 --> 00:05:16.864
from the masters to do what they were supposed to do.

00:05:16.864 --> 00:05:18.956
(***)

00:05:19.412 --> 00:05:24.155
so you think that um gamera was kind of knowing that it's a series

00:05:24.155 --> 00:05:27.479
when he was protecting the world.

00:05:28.104 --> 00:05:32.525
Because he was really focused on that particular boy, not the other boys.

00:05:32.525 --> 00:05:35.730
So that was kind of interesting.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.840
(***

00:05:39.561 --> 00:05:44.083
You think the um Gamera was

00:05:44.083 --> 00:05:47.712
Do you think Gamera really know what was going on?

00:05:49.804 --> 00:05:52.758
yeah You think your gameta was kind of more of a...

00:05:52.758 --> 00:05:55.542
you know it's  (***)

00:05:55.542 --> 00:05:59.102
Think more when you're watching camera, I feel like

00:05:59.102 --> 00:06:03.085
You have to think more when you're watching Gamera compared to Godzilla.

00:06:03.085 --> 00:06:07.658
Gojira you just kind of do whatever he wants

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:09.156
yeah

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.535
So that's kind of how I think, but anyway.

00:06:12.535 --> 00:06:17.092
So which one is your favorite character of Gamera as a person?

00:06:17.092 --> 00:06:17.986
Yeah.

00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:24.617
Oh.
