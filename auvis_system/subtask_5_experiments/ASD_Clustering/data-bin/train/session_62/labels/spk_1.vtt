00:00:07.641 --> 00:00:08.377
Hai.

00:00:12.994 --> 00:00:16.589

00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:53.803
Oh.

00:00:54.915 --> 00:00:58.422

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:09.573
Yeah.

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.333
Oh.

00:01:19.988 --> 00:01:24.950
I'm not a big fan of mayonnaise to start off with so

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.982
I think Japanese mayonnaise is like too much.

00:01:28.982 --> 00:01:33.961
yeah it's too no it's just the flavor

00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:36.474
It's just a...

00:01:36.474 --> 00:01:39.479
Yeah, because I don't like mayonnaise to start off with.

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.473
And when it's so rich in flavor, it's like, oh no.

00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:48.391
Oh really? 

00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:58.221
Oh, that's like a punishment for me.

00:02:09.204 --> 00:02:10.104
Yeah. 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.076
Oh my god, I- I can't do that. You know.

00:02:27.806 --> 00:02:29.416
Oh, no.

00:02:32.573 --> 00:02:36.921
But, Yeah like, I remember Japanese people like the mayonnaise.

00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:41.531
and I was shocked. One time I wanted to eat buta kimchi.

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:45.585
like the pork sauteed with kimchi and I made it

00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:48.380
Yeah, and then my cousin's like, oh

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.019
I'll tell you the best way to eat it and I just wanted my kimchi and pork.

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.682
And she takes the mayonnaise and pours it over.

00:02:56.682 --> 00:02:59.196
and puts like the cheese

00:02:59.196 --> 00:03:04.141
and the torokeru, yeah, that... that yeah that instant cheese.

00:03:04.141 --> 00:03:08.933
pops it in the microwave and gives it back to me and I'm like you just destroyed

00:03:09.015 --> 00:03:11.038
I really didn't eat.

00:03:11.447 --> 00:03:13.982
I was like so upset.

00:03:15.577 --> 00:03:18.518
But I can't- I can't even imagine.

00:03:18.518 --> 00:03:19.904
Yeah. Yeah.

00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:25.264
Yeah.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.794

00:03:31.315 --> 00:03:32.918

00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:40.266

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.755
Yeah.

00:03:47.307 --> 00:03:49.826
I- I hate bananas.

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.652
That's more of like I used to love banana as a kid

00:03:53.652 --> 00:03:56.959
And then I went to a Chinese restaurant.

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.474
and the people that are served like

00:03:59.474 --> 00:04:03.928
Fried banana. Never eat fried bananas at a Chinese restaurant.

00:04:03.928 --> 00:04:08.619
It was like I think like a banana that was almost about to go rotten.

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.406
so it was really like slimy.

00:04:11.504 --> 00:04:14.326
and sick and

00:04:14.392 --> 00:04:18.813
it was just disgusting and every time I eat a banana that

00:04:18.813 --> 00:04:23.774
The flavor just and the smell like comes back to life.

00:04:23.774 --> 00:04:28.363
I think it's like maybe seven. Yeah.

00:04:28.363 --> 00:04:32.092
And ever since then, I just don't like bananas.

00:04:38.104 --> 00:04:42.404
Strawberry like bananas, banana cream pie.

00:04:45.915 --> 00:04:47.196

00:04:49.897 --> 00:04:50.842
Yeah.

00:04:53.218 --> 00:04:55.549
