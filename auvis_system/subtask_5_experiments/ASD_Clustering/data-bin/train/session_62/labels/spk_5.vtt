He snapped the neck in half and it just drank the blood or green blood thingy.

00:02:44.741 --> 00:02:49.380

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.039
Oh, they're examining the...

00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:37.804
Oh.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.753
Pregnant! So it was a female, female Godzilla.

00:03:43.753 --> 00:03:48.056
It's, it's always a Mama Godzilla though, right? Usually.

00:03:48.056 --> 00:03:51.650
Right? It's  al- always female. No?

00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:54.106
No.

00:03:57.741 --> 00:04:00.763
Usually he, but when the...

00:04:00.763 --> 00:04:05.758
Mira, Mini Gojira King, that was her mom. That was her mom.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.819
I thought that was a Mom. It was Dad. Really?

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.814
Oh, damn. There was no Mama? Oh, I thought there was always a Mama.

00:04:19.948 --> 00:04:21.502
Son of Godzilla.

00:04:21.907 --> 00:04:23.527
That was the father?

00:04:25.461 --> 00:04:26.517
Oh.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.086
Oh, Godzilla, okay, yeah, yeah, but that was like more humor.

00:04:35.086 --> 00:04:39.862
They had, it was a comedy. Yeah, comedy. Yeah, they

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.756
Yeah, it had the boxing move. Yeah, yeah.

00:04:47.005 --> 00:04:52.528
He did the shake. Yeah, yeah, a couple of times. Like jumping up and down. Up and down.

00:04:52.609 --> 00:04:55.627
That's the kind of saying it, in your face.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.829
Yeah.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.640
Never flew before, but they tried to figure out that if we wanted to have the Godzilla fly.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.859
What can they do and that's the probably best idea they came up with.

00:05:13.859 --> 00:05:16.863
Oh, put the put the face around his a

00:05:16.863 --> 00:05:21.740
under his neck, under his legs and then just let him blew, blow up.

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.761
The fire and the heat too.

00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:26.645
Really?

00:05:28.512 --> 00:05:31.345
The new... the Shin Godzilla?

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.134
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They want the Godzilla to swim, but not to fly.

00:05:46.822 --> 00:05:47.930
Yeah. Yeah. 

00:05:51.266 --> 00:05:53.628
Destroyer? Like the, the boat?

00:05:55.848 --> 00:05:56.782
