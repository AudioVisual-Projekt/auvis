00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.472
Ah Ronan Farrow, he's a journalist. He um his book was

00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:58.008
Catch and Kill, it's about the rule of Harvard Weinstein.

00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:02.261
***He was doing a lot of research on it.

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.775
Um So that was really...um

00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:08.438
 fascinating to me. I love those journalistic um in-depth

00:01:08.438 --> 00:01:12.656
coverage right over here. Someone's going undercover investigating.

00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:15.525
Huh no um so that was fun.

00:01:15.525 --> 00:01:21.268
Yes, it was a suspenseful, you know read and um and it's completely

00:01:21.228 --> 00:01:22.866
 just not fiction.

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:26.815

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.122

Um And they contributed to the whole mental health wellness um

00:01:39.117 --> 00:01:43.634
um industry because their family, she had like...

00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:48.629
10 or 12 kids, and um but

00:01:49.107 --> 00:01:53.983
About five of a hundred of them are schizophrenic. They are diagnosed with schizophrenia.

00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:56.581
medically. So that whole...

00:01:57.059 --> 00:02:00.679
 um, They they became this huge scientific study, because

00:02:00.918 --> 00:02:02.875
just because of the nature out there.

00:02:02.994 --> 00:02:06.512
Then they wanted to test out the genetics of it and I am really came

00:02:06.432 --> 00:02:10.250
