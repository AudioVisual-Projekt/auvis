00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.916
huhuhahah

00:02:39.568 --> 00:02:43.094
It's kind of like a like a Netflix drama, right

00:02:43.094 --> 00:02:47.700
Like a like the first the first season or the first episode doesn't sit with you.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.456
Ch move on to the next

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:55.329
ahm least most recent book that I picked up was called Culture Man.

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.361
Have you ever heard about that?. I think it's cult the kids called the Culture Map.

00:02:59.641 --> 00:03:03.124
So with it's story or it's a book about how

00:03:03.124 --> 00:03:07.444
A business consultant that deals with people from different cultures.

00:03:07.444 --> 00:03:10.819
He did it, not not a study, but like he...

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.653
He ah wrote about how different

00:03:13.613 --> 00:03:17.232
 people from different countries have like mannerisms.

00:03:17.232 --> 00:03:22.142
and like cultural like cues that other other...

00:03:22.142 --> 00:03:24.658
people don't have, and like

00:03:24.658 --> 00:03:27.576
There was this one um chapter about how

00:03:28.574 --> 00:03:30.934
like Chinese people and Asian people like

00:03:30.934 --> 00:03:33.803
They.. when they're in a meeting, like...

00:03:33.803 --> 00:03:38.293
Asian people will always, the subordinates will always stay quiet.

00:03:38.293 --> 00:03:42.291
because they're always waiting for like permission to speak.

00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:46.797
Right. And opposed to like some, like a Western person who would.

00:03:46.797 --> 00:03:51.319
be more assertive men. So they have people who are like...

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:54.073
You know like they have miscommunications about

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:57.462
Or like miscommunications in like within a team.

00:03:58.221 --> 00:04:02.457
And so like, you know, the boss would hire hire somebody from like France.

00:04:02.457 --> 00:04:05.022
ha and French are really direct.

00:04:05.022 --> 00:04:09.663
um and then they don't they so when there's like American people like

00:04:09.663 --> 00:04:12.177
prey like they always do the whole...

00:04:12.177 --> 00:04:16.868
affirmation and then they give criticism, right? For for Americans, right?

00:04:16.868 --> 00:04:21.458
So, for French people, when they hear that, the first thing they hear is a praise.

00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:25.457
And then they did they just come in. That's it, you know?

00:04:25.457 --> 00:04:30.116
Huhu, So they don't yeah, they don't they don't pick up on my cassaro like...

00:04:30.116 --> 00:04:34.958
push towards like some kind of you know constructive, like, you know...

00:04:35.637 --> 00:04:39.026
 something so like it's it's always kind of this sound

00:04:39.544 --> 00:04:42.756
This interesting kind of juxtaposition about these two.

00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:46.805
 cultures and I thought that that was really interesting because it's me

00:04:46.805 --> 00:04:49.386
like growing up, you know.

00:04:49.386 --> 00:04:51.934
Is at at Asain

00:04:52.214 --> 00:04:56.761
or Japanese-American here, you know? I think that always kind of...um

00:04:56.761 --> 00:05:01.756
being between cultures is a real interest for me. So that book really kind of...

00:05:01.756 --> 00:05:05.081
It was a very interesting read for me as well. yeah

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:08.083
 culture map, I think that was called huhu

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:12.016
I don't remember either. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's interesting.

00:05:13.416 --> 00:05:18.057
yeah, box was, no, we have a hobbies.

00:05:18.057 --> 00:05:22.023
Hobbies. I have a lot of hobbies, but I just don't have much time.

00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:27.521
So it's really hard to like have time to do the things that I want to do.

00:05:27.441 --> 00:05:31.658
Because it, the lat latest thing is

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:38.240
I like crafting a lot, like I love like

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.163
making things, so

00:05:43.946 --> 00:05:47.521
um, have you ever played the cricket?

00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:52.516
A cricket, It's like a like a cutting machine. yeah, and so like

00:05:52.516 --> 00:05:55.453
You can design like your own

00:05:55.453 --> 00:05:58.439
like, designs and then make the...

00:05:58.478 --> 00:06:03.131
thing cut it for you and then you construct it out of that. So it's like cards.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.527
Or like... Or what is it?

00:06:06.487 --> 00:06:09.930
like cleaning and doing some HTVs.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.925
cutting and then you can iron it on to like products like tote bags and like

00:06:14.925 --> 00:06:19.297
T-shirts and stuff. So that kind of stuff is fine.

00:06:19.895 --> 00:06:23.076
yeah. Are you crafter? Do you do craft around?

00:06:26.763 --> 00:06:27.961
mmm

00:06:34.462 --> 00:06:36.913
Yeah, huhuhhah

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:40.926
