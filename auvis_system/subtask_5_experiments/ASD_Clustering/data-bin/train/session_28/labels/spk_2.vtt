00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.246
Oh what creative hobbies that I would get into.

00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:39.046
I wanted to get into painting.

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:41.561
My mom actually might have.

00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:44.836
In high school, my sister was...

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:48.109
a really good art. She painted.

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:50.724
And she had 

00:00:50.724 --> 00:00:53.238
our teacher who loved her..

00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:58.193
Pieces i thought she was the best thing ever. And so when I entered school...

00:00:58.217 --> 00:01:02.402
high school and I wanted to take an art class. She was the only art teacher.

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:06.991
And when I went in her class, and I was drawing, and when she...

00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:11.161
I found out that my sister was... I thought I was her sister.

00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:13.674
She just dropped everything.

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:17.927
and went to the whole class and tell them how wonderful my sister was.

00:01:17.927 --> 00:01:22.247
What a great artist she was. And I thought, yes!

00:01:22.247 --> 00:01:25.842
That turned me off. That turned me off because...

00:01:25.842 --> 00:01:29.605
In high school she was only if you wanted to

00:01:29.605 --> 00:01:32.119
progress in art, she was your ally.

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.718
And I don't want to go through this.

00:01:34.718 --> 00:01:39.679
So I turned to journalism. But I would like to get back into art.

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.379
I did try umm myself watercolors

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:45.872
some paints yeah

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:50.765
And I bought a few things to try to start up again.

00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:55.491
This was several years ago and I never really progressed.

00:01:55.491 --> 00:01:59.339
I dropped it and i..

00:01:59.339 --> 00:02:02.561
But I'd like to pick it up again because I did.

00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:05.414
into a art and maybe i..

00:02:05.414 --> 00:02:10.257
Maybe there's certain kinds that draw me. You know, like that I like better. Because I think...

00:02:10.257 --> 00:02:15.015
I've always enjoyed drawing, but I always thought, well, I'd like to do something in

00:02:15.015 --> 00:02:18.221
color. So I naturally thought.

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.956
Watercolor will be easiest to get into.

00:02:20.956 --> 00:02:25.123
It's hard, right?

00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:32.345
Yes yeah

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:37.340
Ohh..

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.463
Yeah, it takes a lot of

00:02:40.463 --> 00:02:45.457
practice and I got these art books and yeah it's hard. It's hard to learn on your own.

00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:49.642
So maybe if I went and took a class somewhere, it might be more fun.

00:02:49.642 --> 00:02:54.571
And then I started to ask him questions about her.

00:02:59.701 --> 00:03:04.493
It was always..

00:03:04.493 --> 00:03:08.003
Colorpencils i did yeah...so i enjoyed colorpencils

00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:10.803
And just the irregular pencils, right?

00:03:10.803 --> 00:03:14.178
And I think that's probably the median threat.

00:03:14.178 --> 00:03:18.533
It's just the easiest, the one that I'm most familiar with and most comfortable with.

00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:22.617
But it doesn't, I feel like I don't expand much beyond that.

00:03:22.617 --> 00:03:26.397
So I'd like to try my hand at something.

00:03:26.397 --> 00:03:30.261
And maybe watercolor is not the way to go. Maybe I should try it.

00:03:30.261 --> 00:03:35.255
colors i heard something yeah....just to try something

00:03:35.255 --> 00:03:35.475
you

00:03:37.702 --> 00:03:42.462
My sister used to do oil painting.

00:03:42.462 --> 00:03:45.380
Just so the kids can, yeah, just...

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.469
It was a process and she would have to do it outside.

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:52.839
Because of the smells, right?

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:55.422
So yes

00:03:55.995 --> 00:04:00.180
Have you ever taken any girl classes or what have you?

00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:03.606
Oh okay

00:04:17.832 --> 00:04:22.286
Oh okay

00:04:28.142 --> 00:04:31.534
Sneaky! We used to do that when I was a kid too.

00:04:31.534 --> 00:04:34.048
yes

00:04:34.048 --> 00:04:37.220
There is a reason for that.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.461
I always thought of it as a Japanese thing too

00:04:40.461 --> 00:04:43.600
Yes yes

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.244
Yes uh huh a little

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.475
Ohhh okay

00:04:57.691 --> 00:04:59.057
Yes.

00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:29.061
Ohh I see

00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:30.259
yes

00:05:42.088 --> 00:05:44.941
Ohh

00:05:44.941 --> 00:05:49.276
So do you feel your...

00:05:49.276 --> 00:05:52.179
(***)

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:56.162
You back to that

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.792
Oh you do oh

00:06:10.792 --> 00:06:14.386
Yes yeah

00:06:17.307 --> 00:06:19.804
It is fun

00:06:19.804 --> 00:06:22.369
Ha..ha..ha

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:27.364
It brings you enjoyment though, that's gotta be, you know, It's huge

00:06:27.364 --> 00:06:30.300
Health benefits that's it, right?
