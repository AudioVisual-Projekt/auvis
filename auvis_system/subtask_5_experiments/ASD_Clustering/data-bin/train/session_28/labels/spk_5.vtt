00:01:06.716 --> 00:01:10.445
Really good. Like last

00:01:10.444 --> 00:01:15.069
Like a month ago Keiko wanted to do takeout so we just did and it was

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:18.748
like the hamburger takeout and then the hamburger was

00:01:18.748 --> 00:01:21.465
So good.

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:27.000
And it's a hit or like, it's kind of interesting work.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.661
Certain days it's like jam-packed, like every seat taken.

00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:35.235
And then the one day I went, I was like, there's not a single customer here.

00:01:41.428 --> 00:01:45.021
I don't know, but it's good. It's good then like

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:49.881

Have you done Manatsumi lately?

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:08.883

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:26.551

00:03:40.412 --> 00:03:44.496
Miyabi Uni.

00:03:48.782 --> 00:03:53.777
But is this still open? Because I think it closed. Like it did survive the pandemic.

00:03:53.777 --> 00:03:55.297
Yeah.

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:05.877
Yeah, it really didn't survive the pandemic but the...

00:04:26.583 --> 00:04:30.312
