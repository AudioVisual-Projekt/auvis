WEBVTT

00:00:22.846 --> 00:00:25.631
Yeah. They knew it. I didn't know they had though, but then like

00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:29.563
I don't know, is there like a book on the language of Elvish or something?

00:00:29.886 --> 00:00:32.987
like how do they like I've only like seen like

00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:36.612
It's like the end of Lord of the Rings book, there's like some parts of it.

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:40.894
yeah but like, like what's like the actual language look like?

00:00:43.324 --> 00:00:48.682
Yes. If you could learn Elvish, you could use that secret kind of code, but then if you're the only one who knows it, then 

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:52.179
That's a bit confusing. Honestly, somehow me and another elf.

00:00:57.627 --> 00:01:01.660
Wait, wait, Game of Thrones? Oh, Game of Thrones, they made one?

00:01:02.148 --> 00:01:04.647
Oh, they make, they make like, out of Elvish?

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:08.038
Alright. Okay. Oh...

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:13.772
Yeah. 

00:01:16.397 --> 00:01:17.367
Yes.

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:22.158
Yeah, yeah it's a little off-topic, but Star Wars also have that kind of language, but then

00:01:22.078 --> 00:01:23.731
like... It's just letters.

00:01:24.902 --> 00:01:25.588
Huh.

00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.388
But... Yeah, but then they never....

00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:30.500
Yeah. 

00:01:30.597 --> 00:01:31.243
Yeah. 

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:32.737
Yeah. 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.484
Yeah, that's kind of it, yeah, but anyway.

00:01:44.956 --> 00:01:45.885
Yeah. 

00:01:53.938 --> 00:01:54.786
Um...

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.933
Maybe four. Four? Yeah, I like it.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.006
Four. Four is good.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:03.811
Original film.

00:02:07.472 --> 00:02:11.420
Yeah, yeah. There are lot of like, there are a lot of strange trilogies like

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.241
but then i kind of like the middle of the i kind of like two towers.

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:20.295
in the movie. Well I, I don't know. I kind of like Return of the King but then

00:02:20.295 --> 00:02:23.068
um you already want to watch

00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:28.265
um, fellowships, so in the end we always go to two towers. So I guess that's the one.

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:38.088
Yeah. 

00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:46.109
Oh.

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:50.514
Yeah. 

00:03:06.498 --> 00:03:07.185
Yeah. 

00:03:11.955 --> 00:03:13.288
Oh...

00:03:16.103 --> 00:03:17.073
Oh.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.233
Oh, that's good.

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.539
Wait, like the kids in your class?

00:03:43.245 --> 00:03:44.295
Aah.

00:03:51.871 --> 00:03:54.146
I mean but yeah.

00:03:53.985 --> 00:03:58.381
But then, If I ever, If I get into a book, a good book, which I am,

00:03:58.341 --> 00:04:01.985
don't usually get into, maybe I come by. Well, maybe a lot, but like, 

00:04:01.985 --> 00:04:06.962
like usually I like read into like far into the night and then read until the end.

00:04:06.962 --> 00:04:09.527
like again, it's an interesting book.

00:04:14.406 --> 00:04:18.334
I guess in the end like kind of like mystery type.

00:04:18.455 --> 00:04:21.188
In the end like in the end like if you like

00:04:21.188 --> 00:04:25.576
Around everything I've read together, it's kind of mystery kind are my favorites.

00:04:26.254 --> 00:04:27.062
Yeah. 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.129
Yeah, those are kinda like... I guess I kinda like those.

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:34.908
Kind of like histo, like a historical fiction.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.026
It's real but it's not.

00:04:39.156 --> 00:04:40.877
It's real but it's not.

00:04:51.362 --> 00:04:54.805
well so far i've been reading mostly from like um

00:04:54.805 --> 00:04:57.792
Like a ancient Middle East.

00:04:57.792 --> 00:05:00.896
Favorite. Yeah, I kind of like that.

00:05:00.896 --> 00:05:05.519
Something like the... I I only been, I've only been reading the good books.

00:05:07.021 --> 00:05:07.708
Yeah. 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.733
Oh, yeah. That only once.

00:05:12.742 --> 00:05:17.737
Yeah. I usually try to um, but yeah, I got kinda, maybe twice.

00:05:17.737 --> 00:05:21.432
Yeah, but like I can't really help reading until the end.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.057
Yeah. 

00:05:43.487 --> 00:05:46.038
Wait, what was the message of the book? I never read...

00:05:49.446 --> 00:05:51.218
Oh okay, that...

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.230
Aah...

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:03.874
Yeah. But then back to Lord of the rings. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.208
Yeah. 

00:06:08.754 --> 00:06:12.682
So... Which is film um, um, I guess I...

00:06:12.682 --> 00:06:15.601
Um... Which is your favorite character from Fellowship?

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.050
Yeah, I guess.
