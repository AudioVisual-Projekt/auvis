00:00:24.389 --> 00:00:27.613
Okay. Hi! What we're talking about?

00:00:28.832 --> 00:00:30.606
Your favorite chords!

00:00:38.754 --> 00:00:40.253
So there's no tonic?

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:42.315
There's no... fourth?

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.015
Okay, so it's like E over the two...

00:00:53.908 --> 00:00:54.926
It's like...

00:00:56.541 --> 00:00:59.763
G A, so it's a what? B

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.606
It sounds like a bass beat.

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:07.729
B7 Yeah, yeah B7 and then over E.

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.499
Right? Over E. So it's not like an E major chord like

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:13.887
that's probab...

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:19.272
Yeah, with the left hand. Bottom. Yeah. So, over E.

00:01:31.218 --> 00:01:35.370
Have you ever read the um... the dunk uh do

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.340
thing about how Soc Socrates they...

00:01:39.858 --> 00:01:44.500
He wrote about how each mode and each key like has a different kind of

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.910
characters. Yeah... Of course he have.

00:01:53.263 --> 00:01:55.288
Oh, interesting.

00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:04.702
I don't know. I think we have to Google it.

00:02:05.553 --> 00:02:06.615
famous one.

00:02:13.092 --> 00:02:14.599
heroic. sharp.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.386
Yeah. 

00:02:19.363 --> 00:02:22.688
Because there was there was like somebody's symphony huh. heroic

00:02:22.688 --> 00:02:24.733
can't fake 'em heroic

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.393
Yeah. mmh.

00:02:26.562 --> 00:02:27.427
Yes.

00:02:39.966 --> 00:02:40.871
mmh

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:46.954
Yeah, yeah, that's probably what it's based off of.

00:02:46.954 --> 00:02:48.861
Okay, interesting.

00:02:50.183 --> 00:02:51.087
mmh

00:02:56.117 --> 00:02:59.030
How would you, how would you explain a mode?

00:03:29.653 --> 00:03:32.448
So it's like you play a C major.

00:03:32.448 --> 00:03:37.107
scale but you can start on any note but you have to play it in

00:03:37.107 --> 00:03:41.994
with the accidentals of C major. Is that right?

00:03:44.768 --> 00:03:45.672
key yeah.

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:49.104
within the pattern of the C major.

00:04:02.115 --> 00:04:05.591
Right, but it has to keep a certain like harmonic.

00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:08.038
like relationship between the notes.

00:04:09.056 --> 00:04:09.961
Yeah. 

00:04:11.193 --> 00:04:16.086
It's like F sharp D Dorian is D. D Major, right?

00:04:17.662 --> 00:04:21.763
Yeah, that got F sharp and C sharp. Right?

00:04:21.566 --> 00:04:23.405
That's two sharps, right?

00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:34.060
See, that  see that's why I I know. Yeah.

00:04:35.043 --> 00:04:36.613
So, Yeah. I don't.

00:04:36.573 --> 00:04:40.692
So I always like when my students ask me like what modes are I'm like, mmh...

00:04:40.692 --> 00:04:46.080
Let's just focus on this one. You have to play. This is C major. We call it Ionian.

00:04:50.952 --> 00:04:51.699
Yeah. 

00:04:55.047 --> 00:04:58.337
Yeah, so like jazz people.

00:05:04.891 --> 00:05:07.692
so like it always like confuses me like how

00:05:07.692 --> 00:05:10.593
like Jazzers, like think about it that way.

00:05:10.593 --> 00:05:14.677
Like I- I really don't understand like how Jazzer's like minds work.

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:18.716
They'd be like, oh, you just play it from this note in like Dorian. I was like...

00:05:24.635 --> 00:05:26.069
Yeah. I like...

00:05:28.565 --> 00:05:32.836
Have you guys ever heard um Jason. Jacob Collier? um

00:05:32.836 --> 00:05:34.383
talk about music theory.

00:05:35.367 --> 00:05:39.990
Jacob Collier is like this like just this prodigy and just this

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.613
person that like hears harmony in this like

00:05:44.613 --> 00:05:50.474
very complex way like I don't even know how to like describe him. I can't describe him.

00:05:52.005 --> 00:05:56.207
Harm... Yeah, he's like really amazing at harmonizing things.

00:05:56.207 --> 00:05:59.413
So he does this thing where like he'll have...

00:05:59.413 --> 00:06:01.978
um like, I think it was during the pandemic.

00:06:02.018 --> 00:06:07.327
like he would take a, a video of someone singing and he would harmonize it and his like

00:06:07.485 --> 00:06:10.747
it is his... Yeah, it's like theory.

00:06:10.668 --> 00:06:14.264
Well, it's not his theory, but it's just like music theory and he would just...

00:06:14.264 --> 00:06:17.048
create these amazing harmonies and he'd like

00:06:17.048 --> 00:06:20.692
with nine of himself singing all the notes. You know.

00:06:20.692 --> 00:06:22.505
He got really...
