Wait, are you brave enough to eat street food?

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:12.456
In any country because I'm always scared about

00:03:12.471 --> 00:03:18.650
getting si... like stomach ache. Because like sometimes like the water that you just don't agree with

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.553
And then when you order street food like my

00:03:21.553 --> 00:03:25.736
Brother-in-law, He he could eat anything off the street and he's fine.

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.527
Yes, like a... just anything.

00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:31.290
Yeah, street vendors better in anything.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.741
He can eat anything. But I...

00:03:35.373 --> 00:03:39.410
I would get deathly ill if I...

00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:42.147
Yeah.

00:03:42.758 --> 00:03:43.665
Yeah. 

00:03:46.437 --> 00:03:47.266
Yeah. 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:52.703
Yeah, so in the U.S. I'm okay.

00:03:52.624 --> 00:03:58.182
And in Japan most part I feel it's okay

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:00.675
Yeah. 

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:03.184
So you're fine?

00:04:04.041 --> 00:04:05.737
It was okay.

00:04:08.273 --> 00:04:09.217
Yeah.

00:04:13.106 --> 00:04:17.426
Yeah... Oh, wait. Last time I went to, when I went to Egypt,

00:04:17.647 --> 00:04:18.475
Um...

00:04:18.807 --> 00:04:22.488
Like the vendors were filling the water bottles.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.775
with the tap water!

00:04:24.802 --> 00:04:25.749
I just

00:04:25.761 --> 00:04:28.428
on the side they have all these empty

00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:31.934
water bottles and they were just filling it up.

00:04:32.237 --> 00:04:33.421
It's a scam.

00:04:33.592 --> 00:04:37.608
A... Yeah. In someone I saw that. I was like oh my God.

00:04:40.393 --> 00:04:43.464
I don't know if that was meant for locals.

00:04:43.464 --> 00:04:48.222
You know? to locals that I was looking out. Check all my water bottles.

00:04:48.222 --> 00:04:52.154
To see if it's sealed. Yeah.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.305
Mmh. Mmh. Yeah, I see you have to be careful.

00:05:08.156 --> 00:05:08.932
Yeah.

00:05:11.854 --> 00:05:12.801
Yeah. 

00:05:13.704 --> 00:05:14.730
And...

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:20.600
And I heard...

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:21.918
of

00:05:24.404 --> 00:05:25.272
Yeah. 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.183
So I...

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:33.350
And I was also...

00:05:36.505 --> 00:05:38.044
Yeah. And...

00:05:38.644 --> 00:05:41.159
I think it's better now, but 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.887
in the past, like I even when I started to travel.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.921
I was told be careful of showering too, because a little bit of the, like

00:05:49.356 --> 00:05:53.175
Yeah, or when you're brushing your teeth and a lot of people don't notice.

00:05:53.175 --> 00:05:57.950
And they're using tap water, right? How many of us really open up a new...

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.865
mineral... Yeah. To brush the teeth and so

00:06:01.746 --> 00:06:06.370
In Egypt, I was told by the tour guide, that don't forget.

00:06:06.488 --> 00:06:10.471
If you don't want to ruin your trip, make sure you buy a water, like a big...

00:06:10.471 --> 00:06:14.323
water bottle for even brushing your teeth.

00:06:14.757 --> 00:06:15.605
Yeah.
