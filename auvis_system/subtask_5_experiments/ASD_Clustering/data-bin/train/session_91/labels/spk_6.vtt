WEBVTT

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.328
right.

00:00:18.634 --> 00:00:22.690
Oh, I could pick, there's so many songs that come to my mind to make.

00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.569
but I couldn't shake

00:00:26.617 --> 00:00:29.344
Like 20 songs like...

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.418
I know, it's so many. I think I'll pick, probably a...

00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:40.335
Probably the one, one by Cassiopeia called Midnight Rendezvous.

00:00:40.887 --> 00:00:42.265
But it's like...

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.684
It's so good.

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:46.403
Yeah. 

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:51.372
it's so groovy like the the groove that they have like throughout the whole song is so good

00:00:51.372 --> 00:00:56.721
Like makes you want to dance, you know, like when I'm sitting down listening to I want to like stand up.

00:00:57.115 --> 00:00:59.157
You know. I like it.

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:01.376
mmh

00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:10.052
Yeah. And it's got such a good such a cool guitar solo, like so unique sounding.

00:01:10.052 --> 00:01:13.631
Like it's not like any guitar solo I've heard before

00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:17.720
It's like really interesting. It's kind of jazzy but it's like

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.601
not. It's like really dissonant, like it's hardly in the key.

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:26.162
It hardly place note on the key I guess. Yes.

00:01:26.123 --> 00:01:27.597
It's really cool, though.

00:01:30.403 --> 00:01:32.885
And the drums are super crazy.

00:01:53.522 --> 00:01:58.518
I'd tell them to put like gospel music. I think gospels should be like

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:02.433
more popular again. More like... Yeah.

00:02:02.708 --> 00:02:05.572
or like that old like Christian rock

00:02:05.572 --> 00:02:10.195
you know from like the 60s, 70s, 80s.

00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:18.819
I do know Keith Green.

00:02:19.811 --> 00:02:20.678
Yeah. 

00:02:21.968 --> 00:02:22.834
Yeah. 

00:02:23.307 --> 00:02:27.374
Yeah, he's really good. I've seen him.  Because I think lots of people

00:02:27.374 --> 00:02:32.319
they like... Yeah, They they only listen to the Christian contemporary music nowadays.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.367
Or like lots of people that's like

00:02:35.642 --> 00:02:38.432
what they think of when they think of Christian music.

00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:42.005
But like if someone who's not a Christian hears...

00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:46.965
some music that sounds like better than I think. Then I think

00:02:46.965 --> 00:02:50.031
maybe they'd be more interested in being a Christian.

00:02:52.604 --> 00:02:53.510
Yeah. 

00:03:11.822 --> 00:03:13.240
Yeah, that's good.

00:03:19.118 --> 00:03:20.501
Chris Franklin.

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:30.404
Wow.

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:15.632
Really?
