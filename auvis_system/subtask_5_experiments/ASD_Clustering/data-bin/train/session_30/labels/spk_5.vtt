WEBVTT

00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:07.054
Well, we can start.

00:00:39.115 --> 00:00:44.077
Okay, well, we'll see. Going back to the (***)

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:46.980
Yeah, pandemic.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.725
Okay, go back to the food.

00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:59.112
it is

00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:40.726
yeah

00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:45.047
habiro good yeah yeah, yeah.

00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:52.336
You know, but I think nowadays with so many foreign travelers, there's got to be a

00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:56.099
Yeah

00:02:49.204 --> 00:02:53.458
If you want to know about food recommendations you need to go

00:02:53.458 --> 00:02:57.811
You need to ask her, because I guess I'm not a foodie.

00:03:02.722 --> 00:03:05.877
yeah like, I just.

00:03:06.148 --> 00:03:11.042
go walk around, like I enjoy more of the sightseeing.

00:03:11.042 --> 00:03:13.960
And then if I combine...

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.419
and run into a good place, then I'm happy.

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.542
But if it's not there, I don't seek it out.

00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:24.372
That's not my number one priority, yeah.

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.067
Like I like it when like

00:03:32.067 --> 00:03:35.392
When I lived in Sunday, like I would

00:03:35.392 --> 00:03:38.345
purchase like the like a...

00:03:38.632 --> 00:03:42.547
of like all the, you know.

00:03:42.547 --> 00:03:47.086
Yeah, and then so that's when I like whenever I have time I would go.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.229
to different places.

00:03:50.174 --> 00:03:53.972
And that I enjoy doing, but I.

00:03:54.156 --> 00:03:58.139
I never did it when I traveled. Yeah.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.188
Yeah.

00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:10.138
Yeah.

00:04:38.184 --> 00:04:40.580
but i don't I don't enjoy

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.592
I don't i actually like steakhouses here though.

00:04:45.592 --> 00:04:50.570
I don't like Wagyu. but this like it's too..

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.114
No, but Japanese meat, like when you eat it...

00:04:54.114 --> 00:04:58.265
it's fatty and the reason why like the fatty meat was

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:01.489
is popular in Japan is because...

00:05:01.489 --> 00:05:04.594
Japanese people like to cook their meat well done.

00:05:04.594 --> 00:05:09.588
But well done meat and that it gets dry. Yeah and tough.

00:05:09.588 --> 00:05:12.710
So by marbleizing the meat with that,

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.107
You could do it well, Dunnan.

00:05:17.991 --> 00:05:20.523
That like that was kind of like

00:05:20.523 --> 00:05:24.590
how it was done in the past and..yeah

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.040
I don't well, you know that like Japan like the

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.073
law is that you cannot feed livestock any waste.

00:06:01.073 --> 00:06:03.994
material. It has to be...

00:06:03.994 --> 00:06:07.131
made from scratch fresh for that.

00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:11.907
 And so that's why the pork is the quality of the pork is really good.

00:06:16.244 --> 00:06:18.354
