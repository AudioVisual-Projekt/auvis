WEBVTT

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.672
Oh crap, was I recording already?

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:26.471
They're like, oh, once her husband's gone, I guess there's some crazy shit happening in there.

00:00:26.471 --> 00:00:30.622
Are they switching markers in there?

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:47.666
Oh yeah, we tried to attend, didn't we?

00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:52.239
Food, food.

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:03.614
I don't know how to recommend places because I just...

00:01:03.614 --> 00:01:05.975
randomly walk around a little yeah

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:13.248
The thing is, when I do look through...

00:01:13.248 --> 00:01:18.243
Like okay, there's my first time I had social media in the last five six months. I didn't have social media before

00:01:18.243 --> 00:01:23.239
oh yeah and then so but before that I look up Google Maps

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:25.079
for fantasies but

00:01:25.602 --> 00:01:30.597
They do? Because it didn't work out too well for me with Google Maps.

00:01:30.597 --> 00:01:33.549
And then Kegels has a short song?

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.544
He shows me what he looks like because he always finds like bomb faces.

00:01:38.544 --> 00:01:41.531
Yeah, but he uses taberu.

00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:44.281
Taberu good Yeah, but it's all in Japanese

00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:47.606
yeah so I can't yeah yeah

00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:56.314
Oh really? okay

00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:05.326
right

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:11.552
Oh, okay. Okay.

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.621
And then you have pretty good luck with that. 

00:02:53.672 --> 00:02:56.793
sounds like her yeah yeah

00:03:20.605 --> 00:03:21.820
oh okay okay

00:03:57.763 --> 00:04:01.189
When I go, I just look for a place that just does one thing.

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:04.395
I usually avoid places that have like a little bit of everything

00:04:04.395 --> 00:04:09.391
Yeah, and then if they specialize in one thing and that's all they sell then I'll try like that. Yeah

00:04:15.803 --> 00:04:20.798
all right i don't know the place but it was really close to tokyo tower it was a...

00:04:20.798 --> 00:04:23.903
Steak house and that steak messed me up.

00:04:23.903 --> 00:04:28.898
Like, cause after I ate there, eating at steakhouses around here is sad.

00:04:28.898 --> 00:04:30.888
Yeah.

00:04:33.386 --> 00:04:38.381
I don't get it. Like, you know what I mean? Like, we're supposed to be like the steak and hamburgers country, right?

00:04:48.136 --> 00:04:51.881
No, they have more than Wagyu, it's not just Wagyu they have...

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:27.528
But you know what though? I usually get like medium-medium rare.

00:05:27.504 --> 00:05:29.900
You know, both in Japan and here.

00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:36.415
fatty meat here it makes you feel kind of gross when you eat it

00:05:36.415 --> 00:05:37.917
But...

00:05:39.097 --> 00:05:42.996
yeah but then yeah if i eat the same kind of marbling meat in japan i can feel fine

00:05:52.023 --> 00:05:53.847
I don't get it.

00:06:04.021 --> 00:06:07.886
Like this? Oh, I didn't know that.

00:06:12.982 --> 00:06:17.218
The quality of everything is just so much better. Even the produce.
