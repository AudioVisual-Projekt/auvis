There's only one scene because in the Toho's rule.

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:54.236
Godzilla cannot eat people.

00:04:55.097 --> 00:04:58.236
But! But it's minus one.

00:04:59.067 --> 00:05:01.188
They broke the rule.

00:05:01.306 --> 00:05:05.104
Because there's one scene that Godzilla ate people.

00:05:06.352 --> 00:05:10.239
At the first scene when they attack the village.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.652
