00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:17.583
Are there a lot of different types of river cruises in Europe?

00:00:23.608 --> 00:00:28.602
There's that many big rivers? I didn't know that.

00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:41.242
Oh, that sounds really nice.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.811
Yeah! Oh, that sounds really nice

00:00:59.754 --> 00:01:02.859
Oh yeah, yeah, because the river's not that big.

00:01:05.322 --> 00:01:08.867
Oh, that's nice. It...haa...

00:01:10.554 --> 00:01:12.765
Is it expensive?

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.772
Ahaan

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.682
Is it like do they sell it by a package where it includes a flyer?

00:01:27.682 --> 00:01:30.518
the cruise...

00:01:30.518 --> 00:01:34.652
Okay, so that's like just to cruise itself. ok ok

00:01:34.652 --> 00:01:36.811
And how long is the average cruise there?

00:01:39.848 --> 00:01:43.917
Oh, that's a that's a decent amount of time.

00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:47.881
That's a great way to like.. like explore Europe without...

00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:50.463
pushing yourself too hard...yeah

00:01:50.463 --> 00:01:54.817
 Is you're forced to relax...like for the majority of the time?

00:01:54.817 --> 00:01:58.816
And then when you get to a place, go fast and hard, and then come back in.

00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:02.089
Yeah, that sounds pretty good. Yeah, that sounds fun.

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:04.301
But yeah

00:02:05.582 --> 00:02:08.131
But see, I even doing that, I don't know.

00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:12.973
hang out with the people in Japan okay it's just that our last cruise

00:02:12.973 --> 00:02:17.951
I site on (***) in the family

00:02:17.951 --> 00:02:21.344
I don't know. It kind of put a damper on things, you know?

00:02:23.556 --> 00:02:26.743
Especially, I want to strangle like kid you're dealing with.

00:02:26.743 --> 00:02:30.070
Seriously, when we were at the beach when he was flip-flopping?

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.844
I told Sandy at the time I wanted to hit him with the oar I had in my hand

00:02:34.844 --> 00:02:36.837
And so you...

00:02:41.612 --> 00:02:42.552
Yeah!

00:02:42.998 --> 00:02:44.056
Yeah!

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:46.734
Yeah!

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.469
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. See, I'm with you totally 100%. Like, if they're freaked out, that's fine.

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.420
I'm totally okay with it, but I really hated that whole flip-flopping thing.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.908
Yeah...how that's what annoying me, you know? I don't want to smack them.

00:03:09.707 --> 00:03:10.755
Yeah...yeah!

00:03:17.518 --> 00:03:18.388
Yeah!

00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:29.945
Yeah! Yeah.

00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:33.721
Do...Do you think it would have been different like, let's say I was paired with them?

00:03:33.721 --> 00:03:38.717
And I just told him in a stern voice, get in there? Do you think that would have made a difference? 

00:03:38.717 --> 00:03:38.784
you

00:03:38.775 --> 00:03:39.927
Ohhh...

00:03:58.097 --> 00:03:58.991
Ahaan

00:04:02.695 --> 00:04:04.765
Why? He can't swim?

00:04:06.374 --> 00:04:10.036
What? I don't understand why he freaked out then.

00:04:10.036 --> 00:04:15.032
Because if you know how to swim, even if it flips, which it most likely won't when you're sitting

00:04:15.032 --> 00:04:18.844
in it then you're in the water what's the big deal you know

00:04:23.002 --> 00:04:23.871
Hmmm

00:04:24.976 --> 00:04:26.012
Yeah!

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:29.901
Yeah!

00:04:32.117 --> 00:04:33.199
Oh ok

00:04:39.353 --> 00:04:40.341
alright

00:04:50.704 --> 00:04:53.201
Oh yeah yeah yeah...That's on that's on my list too

00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:56.814
Yeah...yeah...thats that one...

00:04:58.906 --> 00:05:01.826
Isn't it like the...(***)

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:06.594
the higher north you go the better? so...

00:05:06.617 --> 00:05:09.098
I... I really go Alaska
