00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:12.808
Okay... So...

00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:14.590
Ahhhh

00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:18.093
We talked about the dwarves.... So...

00:00:19.392 --> 00:00:21.823
Oh...  Sure, and thick and hairy.

00:00:23.712 --> 00:00:27.037
So...  What are other 

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:32.010
any other like okay we can talk about the side characters of the .. yeah..

00:00:31.924 --> 00:00:34.439
that you like, or you can...

00:00:34.546 --> 00:00:37.432
You remember..Well, of course.

00:00:37.432 --> 00:00:41.937
One guy is the Natsai character, he played one of the main characters.

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:45.077
The   dragon slayer 

00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:47.894
Ball   He was cool, dude

00:00:51.205 --> 00:00:53.274
Yeah...

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.009
Ohhh Yeah....

00:00:58.529 --> 00:01:01.311
Ohhh.. Okay.. Yeah..

00:01:06.137 --> 00:01:10.135
Hang... okay.. okay.. But this in the movie he was

00:01:10.912 --> 00:01:14.776
Like that  well respected, but he's... Yeah.

00:01:14.776 --> 00:01:18.776
But people in power didn't like him.

00:01:18.776 --> 00:01:22.809
Yeah  because  she ..  for the  because  she's so...

00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:27.803
He's so just, he's so right, and he's not afraid to speak up.

00:01:27.803 --> 00:01:31.719
Yeah, yeah..  yeah.. yeah..

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:36.410
Bright, bright and prejudiced. (***)

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.999
Bart was pretty unique I mean he ended up to be a leader.. And...

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:44.341
he was already kind of an underlying leader

00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:48.829
Because no one respected the real reader.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.116
that he was a that guy was a reader by the just a title

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.952
but as a people Bart was the one.. yeah..  yeah..

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.657
Yeah.. was the leaser..

00:01:59.844 --> 00:02:02.780
Yeah, yeah... yeah.. yeah...

00:02:03.865 --> 00:02:05.590
Yeah...

00:02:16.447 --> 00:02:18.452
Ah huh.....  Ah huh...

00:02:20.696 --> 00:02:22.141
Yeah...

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.381
To.. to  be...at the end ..    Yeah...

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.654
No.. no.. He was hoping that the doors were green.

00:02:36.654 --> 00:02:39.167
And the endKeith, yeah.

00:02:40.637 --> 00:02:45.530
But  he was also a warrior too, like he actually can defeat Lotta.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.095
Orcs and you know those guys.

00:02:48.095 --> 00:02:53.090
and protect his family and he was a very brave man

00:02:52.982 --> 00:02:57.690
fighting against I mean he did slay the dragon literally

00:02:57.768 --> 00:02:58.933
So..

00:03:04.531 --> 00:03:09.222
Ohh.. But using that  using his son as the...

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:13.086
The Scan  like  yeah.. yeah..     

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.382
Yeah...

00:03:17.317 --> 00:03:18.589
Ahh...hung..

00:03:18.707 --> 00:03:23.364
Make them   story a lot more alive, you think? In that sense?

00:03:23.364 --> 00:03:25.354
Oh yeah, that worked well.

00:03:26.442 --> 00:03:28.382
Ha, ha, ha...

00:03:28.477 --> 00:03:32.324
Sounds like you're taking a class abroad.

00:03:32.324 --> 00:03:36.340
Yeah.. yeah..yeah so that was nice

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.930
And  there's a romance too, right? That happening on the side with dad, the worst.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.967
(***)Helia, that's her name.

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:48.963
yeah yeah yeah so and then they were kind of falling in love but at the same time

00:03:48.898 --> 00:03:52.155
They know it's a forbidden love.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.442
yeah so that kind of draws the more

00:03:55.442 --> 00:03:59.814
connection to the movie audience in the movie.

00:04:04.437 --> 00:04:05.903
Yeah...

00:04:07.155 --> 00:04:10.681
Just a different layer to this whole love story.

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:12.405
Yeah..  yeah...  So..

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:16.924
and he dies so and then

00:04:16.795 --> 00:04:20.812
Yeah...  (***)

00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:28.906
Oh, yeah, yeah. Ohh, you said that the Wasserman doesn't exist in the book.

00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:34.019
yeah yeah yeah...   but there was another like

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:37.579
And you know, (***)  likes that.

00:04:37.579 --> 00:04:41.310
Yeah.  (***)

00:04:41.353 --> 00:04:45.166
yeah yeah yeah .. so that was nice that he kind of

00:04:45.122 --> 00:04:47.637
Did not like control even though he could have

00:04:47.637 --> 00:04:51.822
because he's the prince of that dark place. but he is...

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.829
Yeah... car    (***)   That's so cool! yeah..

00:05:01.624 --> 00:05:03.177
Yeah...

00:05:03.685 --> 00:05:05.457
Hmmm....  Which he did.

00:05:07.937 --> 00:05:12.798
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nothing stopped him.

00:05:12.798 --> 00:05:17.793
Yeah...    But he also did not control. ..Yeah...

00:05:17.793 --> 00:05:20.695
So that was cool.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:23.209
Even though the guy died.

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:28.053
Legolas said, OK, I'm not able to stay here. And that's why he takes off.

00:05:28.053 --> 00:05:33.048
right so he could have just stayed back and just be next to her but no.. Right...?

00:05:33.048 --> 00:05:36.389
And he didn't. He said, I cannot go.

00:05:36.997 --> 00:05:39.899
(***)  See you later.

00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:44.145
Yeah...  Yeah...   Ha.. ha.. ha.. 

00:05:44.286 --> 00:05:49.281
Yeah, yeah. He's not just a guy who's walking on the top of the snow.

00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:53.197
When everybody else is falling in the snow.

00:05:53.197 --> 00:05:57.027
Yeah, yeah. Sinking. So he doesn't sink.

00:05:56.984 --> 00:05:58.334
yeah.. yeah.. yeah... 

00:06:01.365 --> 00:06:05.094
You know what they should do? They should make a movie just for Legolas.

00:06:05.094 --> 00:06:09.497
You know, then everybody needs to watch that.
