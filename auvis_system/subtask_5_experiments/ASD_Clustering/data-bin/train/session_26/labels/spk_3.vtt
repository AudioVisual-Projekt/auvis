00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:59.010

00:01:00.663 --> 00:01:04.864

Wait, what's the first one you said? China Bistro.

00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:37.729
I've probably been there, but I just can't remember.

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.955
But I know one or one noodle

00:02:42.688 --> 00:02:46.251
No, not really. 

00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:50.485
Which one is that?

00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:52.949

 that place that

00:03:37.903 --> 00:03:41.753
Night, I didn't like what we ordered when we went with Greg. I don't think it was the best.

00:03:41.753 --> 00:03:45.818
And I think the usual chef was not there.

00:03:45.818 --> 00:03:50.646
because the taste was a little off. But then I went back again and it was really good.

00:03:51.068 --> 00:03:51.709
Yeah.

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:18.709

00:04:33.694 --> 00:04:36.867

00:04:38.858 --> 00:04:41.608
Oh no, it's near the source.

00:04:41.608 --> 00:04:46.468
It's in a really strip mall. yeah

00:04:46.468 --> 00:04:49.927
It's good, yeah.

00:04:54.112 --> 00:04:59.155
