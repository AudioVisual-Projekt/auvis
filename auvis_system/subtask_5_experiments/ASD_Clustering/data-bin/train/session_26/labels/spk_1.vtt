WEBVTT

00:00:11.228 --> 00:00:16.003
yeah I think he was like hunting from a distance, you know?

00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:28.457
OK. 

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:03.363
Roughly....

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.238
Right.

00:02:55.306 --> 00:02:58.669
Right...

00:03:09.175 --> 00:03:12.060
yeah so um yeah roughly

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.380
Roughly somewhere I mean...i... my parents were immigrants and then I was born here

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.216
My parents married pretty late.

00:03:19.216 --> 00:03:23.113
Umm they had both previously been buried, so they...

00:03:23.113 --> 00:03:27.636
got married within like a year of dating and then had me like right away.

00:03:27.636 --> 00:03:30.504
And my mom was 41 when she got me

00:03:32.226 --> 00:03:37.136
I'm their only kid, yes. And then I have one half-brother who's older than me.

00:03:37.136 --> 00:03:40.106
Umm byy eight years, so I grew up with him

00:03:40.106 --> 00:03:45.101
and I was born and raised in Michoacán, so South Orange County.

00:03:45.714 --> 00:03:50.823
Umm and yeah I like basically lived in the same house for

00:03:50.823 --> 00:03:55.818
all of my life. Yeah, all my childhood. Yeah.

00:03:55.818 --> 00:04:00.020
yeah they do.... yeah yeah so we never moved.... yeah

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.512
I think right before I was born they lived in

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:09.047
a (***) but also in Michigan, so it wasn't far.

00:04:09.047 --> 00:04:13.755
and actually I remember I think my mom still owned it so we went to like go paint it and

00:04:13.755 --> 00:04:18.261
renovate it a little bit before they sold it off and I remember like going up and down the stairs and like having

00:04:18.261 --> 00:04:23.206
fun when I was a little kid but yeah I mean

00:04:23.206 --> 00:04:27.357
Michiveho was like a really quiet suburban area.

00:04:28.858 --> 00:04:32.098
not much to do it's like mostly white

00:04:32.098 --> 00:04:35.355
Umm yeah, but I

00:04:35.355 --> 00:04:40.333
I thnik i thought it was nice. I mean, it's... it feels like a nice area to raise kids.

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:42.459
but..

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:48.518
Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. Greg's sister, right?

00:04:48.518 --> 00:04:50.647
Yeah..yeah

00:04:51.498 --> 00:04:55.824
yeah so..i mean...i know i mean.

00:04:55.824 --> 00:04:59.605
I went to high school in Santa Ana.

00:04:59.605 --> 00:05:03.487
And that was a little bit different. I had to correct the way I did it.

00:05:04.598 --> 00:05:07.317
Yeah it's definitely a little bit different, yeah.

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:11.840
So I went to an arts high school.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.733
Yeah, so I would commute there and I'd carpool with like other girls that lived in

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:21.239
my area um but yeah it was like kind of a long commute for

00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:25.374
Yeah..(***) yeah one way 

00:05:25.737 --> 00:05:29.829
Yeah, I always love going to the taco trucks after school.

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:33.288
It was like definitely a completely different vibe than Bishop E. Ho.

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:40.122
Yeah, yeah, so like there would be like, I think four or five of us.

00:05:40.122 --> 00:05:44.745
And then..the each mom had their designated day. Yeah, that kind of thing.

00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:49.740
yeah so um but it was kind of like a setup system like the school would have like

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.694
forums or whatever where people could

00:05:52.694 --> 00:05:57.689
The parents can meet because a lot of kids come from different areas.

00:06:02.312 --> 00:06:05.317
yeah yeah there were some people who committed like really far

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.978
Yeah, even though I know there is like an arts high school in LA also...yeah
