00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.199
Ha, ha, ha... ha...

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.154

00:00:42.698 --> 00:00:46.242
out of all of them, the story and everything.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.082
Really...?

00:00:54.072 --> 00:00:54.562

Yeah.. it for mail...

00:01:09.191 --> 00:01:13.057
I just felt she was trying too hard to be feisty.

00:01:13.057 --> 00:01:15.909
And I just didn't.

00:01:17.292 --> 00:01:19.790
I'm doing a chant.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.784
I don't know what it was about Sleep is in Seattle. . You know...

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:27.519
I have no idea (***)

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:30.894
When they held their hands they knew, like it was magical.

00:01:30.894 --> 00:01:35.754
I love the way they played on that.

00:01:35.754 --> 00:01:39.213
Ha... ha... ha...

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:54.754
Yeah... Is it what the kids were talking in like...

00:01:54.754 --> 00:01:58.805
Codes and the adults couldn't keep up.

00:02:06.904 --> 00:02:09.975
Ah  huh...      hmmmm....

00:02:20.076 --> 00:02:21.920

00:02:23.313 --> 00:02:24.846
Hmm...

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:27.610
I don't know, but Meg Brannan did a lot.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.849
of other realms close, right?

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.394

Yeah...

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.403
It is. The certain scenes were kind of a little embarrassing too.

00:02:51.482 --> 00:02:54.547
Ha, ha, ha...

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.914

Ryan Reynolds  and  Sandra Bullock.

00:03:51.225 --> 00:03:55.765
It's so funny because that movie like

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:58.324
in terms of the topic.

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:01.890
We always used to joke about it because there's a lot of our friends who...

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.334
are from Japan that wants to stay in

00:04:05.334 --> 00:04:08.067

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.625
to get a working permit from people in Canada. yes..

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:35.388
Especially if they live in that border area, right?

00:04:37.412 --> 00:04:40.467
No, but that's like, to me, that...

00:04:40.444 --> 00:04:42.891

But that's why I'm like, I like that movie. I like the chemistry between.

00:04:50.137 --> 00:04:52.768
Ryan Reynolds and the story

00:04:52.768 --> 00:04:57.594
The storyline was, I was like, the story seemed a little weak to me.
