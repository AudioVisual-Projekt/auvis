WEBVTT

00:00:13.118 --> 00:00:14.980
Hai.. So..

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.307
Yeah...

00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:18.371
So..

00:00:18.577 --> 00:00:19.708
What saying?

00:00:20.474 --> 00:00:23.579
My console. Okay. I like

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:27.989
The  Sardama?

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.985
He was already a part of that group.

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:34.778
Ha... ha... ha...

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.097
And somehow, as wise as he is,

00:00:38.097 --> 00:00:40.629
Sounds like he was not catching it.

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.273
He was not catching that he's kind of being outcast.

00:00:44.273 --> 00:00:48.998
Because he went though... Ahhh..

00:00:49.437 --> 00:00:52.779
Galagio, Gandalf...

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:57.773
They were all talking, but at the end, it really got to an end.

00:00:57.773 --> 00:01:02.617
Gandalf are the main people talking.... yeah... yeah... yeah...

00:01:06.684 --> 00:01:08.574
It's almost like no one's here. (***)

00:01:12.624 --> 00:01:16.606
uh-huh... Yeah...

00:01:18.588 --> 00:01:21.359
Ha, ha, ha...

00:01:21.534 --> 00:01:24.605
And also why him too..he was kind of comical.

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:29.582
in a sense but you yes you're right you're just talking

00:01:29.582 --> 00:01:33.666
No one else is answering.

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:39.814
So... but..    Yeah... yeah... yeah...

00:01:40.264 --> 00:01:44.517
I think they tried because you can see it in the long version.

00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:48.567
The soup scenes or different scenes I think they have joked around.

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:53.427
but it didn't really match with the movie so those are the...

00:01:53.427 --> 00:01:58.338
They can cut those seams out to make it shorter, which I think was smarter.

00:01:58.382 --> 00:02:03.377
yeah but the Lord of the Rings was a lot more serious compared to

00:02:03.332 --> 00:02:06.641
Yeah others... Yeah, yeah.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.677
Yeah, yeah   well, it's starting to get more serious because the situation gets more serious.

00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:18.385
But billboard is still billboard so that brings

00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:21.913
kind of humor even the you know next

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.050
Second one too... wait.. wait..

00:02:24.984 --> 00:02:28.392
yeah when the dragon between dragon and him right

00:02:28.392 --> 00:02:30.907
The way he acts, the way he walks.

00:02:30.907 --> 00:02:34.383
the way he kind of tried to steal that.

00:02:34.338 --> 00:02:37.595
uh arkansas

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.128
Because the way he moves, he's like so beautiful.

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:44.642
And that way he moves his fingers.

00:02:44.642 --> 00:02:47.158
It's always like, don't.

00:02:47.135 --> 00:02:51.623
Don't move, don't move. You know, that kind of thing.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.757
Yeah...

00:02:57.737 --> 00:03:00.235
Yeah, and he sits down.

00:03:00.236 --> 00:03:03.982
Yeah, yeah, he's kind of good... but...

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.411
Yeah...

00:03:12.486 --> 00:03:16.233
Fourdty minutdes..He does end up, he continues to have it.

00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:20.283
yeah yeah yeah even thieves...

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:23.033
you know, escape from the...

00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:25.936
So this is like the last third movie.

00:03:25.936 --> 00:03:30.341
he escapes not escapes but go to meet the uh the woodlands

00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:34.020
uh the king right and then said you you don't want

00:03:34.064 --> 00:03:38.502
You don't want that food.

00:03:38.457 --> 00:03:43.216
the both  she walks and then it's like you uh let the

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.036
prisoner's gold and you're the one who did it and he does..  yes...

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.306
Ha.. ha.. ha..   yes.... and  (***) 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.805
That corkiness is so good.

00:03:56.992 --> 00:04:01.109
other person who kind of brings seriousness.

00:04:01.086 --> 00:04:05.846
Humor is the Lake Town the mean guy.

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:08.629
(***) The one down uni Yeah...

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.425
Unibrow in itself is kind of funny...   Yeah...

00:04:13.624 --> 00:04:17.640
But..   Yeah...

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.573
But he is a very bad guy, but the way he acts...

00:04:21.506 --> 00:04:26.501
kind of brings kind of not a smile but kind of another quirkiness into the movie

00:04:26.568 --> 00:04:30.347
So they and...   , yeah, Ying-Yi character.

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:33.459
And then (***) everybody hates him?

00:04:33.503 --> 00:04:38.161
but it's kind of like not like life-threatening

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:42.029
they're really mean to him and everything but at the same time

00:04:42.953 --> 00:04:45.450
It's not like, I don't know.

00:04:45.495 --> 00:04:50.153
Fourty three was everybody hates him, but I don't know he brings some kind of character

00:04:50.109 --> 00:04:54.597
that doesn't make him so too evil

00:04:56.537 --> 00:04:59.356
Yeah...Yeah, that's a good one.

00:04:59.356 --> 00:05:03.996
and then he tried to be

00:05:03.996 --> 00:05:07.710
like all the masters but he everybody knows he's not

00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:12.416
And he knows he's not, but he's acting like it. so  he tries.

00:05:12.705 --> 00:05:12.755
you.

00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:19.167
Yeah, yeah, yeah. (***)   yeah.. yeah..

00:05:19.167 --> 00:05:23.775
So she can flip side like no problem. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:23.935 --> 00:05:24.954
so..

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.486
Almost like a TV guy guy

00:05:27.507 --> 00:05:28.837
Ha, ha, ha...

00:05:28.938 --> 00:05:32.042
(***)You can be defeated.

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:36.672
Defeated really quickly and then turn sides really quickly.

00:05:36.664 --> 00:05:38.326
Yeah...

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:44.801
Yeah...Just for himself and that's it. And everybody knows that.

00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:48.732
Yeah.. but other..

00:05:48.755 --> 00:05:51.303
Wow..., everybody kind of have their...

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.140
even the elf, what's his name, the one that...

00:05:56.163 --> 00:06:01.141
Legolas has some quirkiness in the second movie, I think.

00:06:01.118 --> 00:06:02.621
The way he..(***)

00:06:04.578 --> 00:06:06.654
That was the way he kind of gives in

00:06:06.747 --> 00:06:08.365
To... hmmm...

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.986
i don't know it's a quirkiness but he's not like

00:06:11.986 --> 00:06:15.917
as serious as the first episode.
