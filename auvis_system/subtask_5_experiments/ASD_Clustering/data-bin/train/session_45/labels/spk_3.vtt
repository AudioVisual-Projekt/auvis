WEBVTT

00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:45.471
Okay, sorry,are going to talk about

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:50.436
(***)Okay, so how are you? What questions do you have?

00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:02.279
Oh no.

00:01:05.923 --> 00:01:09.382
Prime Minister from when?

00:01:09.382 --> 00:01:11.864
I can't even name memory correct?

00:01:12.742 --> 00:01:16.824
Honestly, I think, don't.

00:01:17.635 --> 00:01:21.431
Overdo it because I don't think average Japanese people know.

00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:25.532
Because sometimes the Prime Minister's change out three months. 

00:01:25.598 --> 00:01:26.769
yeah

00:01:34.525 --> 00:01:36.035
okay

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:44.246
Monk?

00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:49.359
What was the question about?

00:01:56.347 --> 00:01:59.434
But was it someone famous?

00:02:05.257 --> 00:02:10.100
You didn't have good research?  Oh, you had good research.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.284
God...I don't know. What else?

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.606
names of the butterfly or is it names of the birds?

00:02:37.606 --> 00:02:40.609
I don't even remember these questions.

00:02:55.723 --> 00:02:57.480
I don't know...wait

00:02:57.667 --> 00:02:58.838
okay

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:05.533
Okay okay..so.....

00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:10.528
I don't know.Yeah,What else is giving you a hard time?

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.287
Yeah.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.517
I think,in your level be picky about the geography.

00:03:28.517 --> 00:03:33.192
I would say think of it through the eyes of cultural geography.

00:03:33.192 --> 00:03:36.313
Why it is geographically?

00:03:36.313 --> 00:03:39.335
That area, why was Osaka...

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.376
Geographically beneficial or advantageous for it to grow.

00:03:45.376 --> 00:03:45.409
you

00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:49.624
(***)

00:03:53.391 --> 00:03:54.640
Poor..

00:03:55.331 --> 00:04:00.225
not mountainous so you would need to know the mount that um

00:04:00.225 --> 00:04:01.474
Surrounds it.

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:06.520
or what surrounds it or...

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.278
Like, like the rivers and stuff. Yeah.

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:13.528
So....

00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:23.493
(***) with the

00:04:24.713 --> 00:04:29.318
Goodeko, Yeah, that's a Japanese.....um

00:04:31.495 --> 00:04:33.367
Like confectionery.

00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:34.690
Yeah

00:04:36.354 --> 00:04:38.582
Yeah, dotonbori

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.295
No, that's just the area, the market area in that.

00:04:46.295 --> 00:04:47.509
But yeah.

00:04:50.176 --> 00:04:53.669
No, I don't know.I don't know when.

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.174
OK, I'm really weak at Osaka. There you go.

00:04:58.174 --> 00:05:03.169
I'm starting out. So if you're asking me specific questions about J-boy,

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.164
Its comfortable question,I need to study myself.

00:05:08.164 --> 00:05:11.438
on that subject matter.

00:05:16.768 --> 00:05:18.032
ho

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.626
I think the general trends, like the overall flow.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.385
Um...

00:05:27.772 --> 00:05:31.974
The whole area is what  taken being looking for.

00:05:31.974 --> 00:05:36.936
so like um like kaisho meiji

00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:38.897
like

00:05:39.433 --> 00:05:44.024
That's a... No wait, it goes Meiji Taisho, Showa.

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:48.021
so.....and then,i sees

00:05:47.989 --> 00:05:51.094
So I think you would be able to tell the general

00:05:51.094 --> 00:05:54.368
Friends ,Its.....Yeah

00:05:59.347 --> 00:06:02.349
Well, they'll ask about like this, I know.

00:06:02.706 --> 00:06:04.279
What?

00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:08.441
why?haa... no, not saying Japanese.

00:06:08.441 --> 00:06:11.631
(***)in the Japanese war.

00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:15.125
and then the Sino-Japanese like

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:18.397
(***)

00:06:21.267 --> 00:06:26.244
Was it Meiji?  Oh yeah, it's 1903-ish..so...may i?

00:06:26.244 --> 00:06:29.080
would been,so but then it would

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.075
the earthquake, like major events that happened that would...

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:38.799
Not mean so,impurial.You need to know imperialism.

00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:41.179
Its  that's for forced Japan to

00:06:41.857 --> 00:06:43.121
