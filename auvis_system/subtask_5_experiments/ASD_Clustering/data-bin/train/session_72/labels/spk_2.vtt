00:00:17.946 --> 00:00:19.672
(***)

00:00:20.063 --> 00:00:23.455
So I was looking and I was looking at all the seafood.

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:25.242
and

00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:29.816
I had my bag on my shoulder and then the hyena.

00:00:29.816 --> 00:00:32.331
And then... ha ha ha

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:36.650
And then Chi-chan was all the way down trying to get a drink for me.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.786
And she's looking at it and she's thinking, oh, Setsuna, you have your...

00:00:40.786 --> 00:00:43.536
bag on the back of my bag.

00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:48.531
That's not good, but she thought that she was going to say something to me but she decided not to.

00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:52.463
But by the time she came, it was all zipped up and open.

00:00:52.463 --> 00:00:54.978
And my wallet was gone.

00:00:54.978 --> 00:00:59.297
Luckily my green card and passport was in the different pockets.

00:00:59.297 --> 00:01:01.896
So it was okay, but yes.

00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:06.553
