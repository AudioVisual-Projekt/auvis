WEBVTT

00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:21.695
So we're talking about the school. Yes.

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:51.801
So what was yours specially?

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:56.104
But like what if photography or like painting

00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:09.351
It sounds like such a fun kind of...

00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:14.345
Did you guys have like sports teams where you played against other countries?

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.684
Wow.

00:01:34.663 --> 00:01:38.628
Oh my gosh, that sounds horrible.

00:01:43.606 --> 00:01:48.484
I wonder if a kid ever got hit in the parking lot, you know, like they're running in the sewers backing out.

00:01:51.318 --> 00:01:54.238
yes

00:01:54.238 --> 00:01:56.482
But one more question, did you guys have prom?

00:02:05.342 --> 00:02:09.308
Yeah, yeah. That makes sense. They usually do have any.

00:02:09.308 --> 00:02:11.097
elsewhere yeah

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.568
yeah

00:02:20.613 --> 00:02:23.145
Wow, that's cool

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.069
Wow!

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.064
Not only are they like the arts, they're the creative bosses.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.065
So I i.. grew up in Tucson, Arizona.

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:47.580
And for the most part...

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.950
I grew up on the south side, and it's south Tucson.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.768
It's just like South L.A except....

00:02:54.768 --> 00:02:58.649
South Tucson has nothing but Mexicans where South LA is like

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:01.164
more latino and black community

00:03:01.164 --> 00:03:05.789
But in Tucson, it literally was just Mexicans.

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:10.445
You're one or two families of like different, you know, with different

00:03:10.445 --> 00:03:14.563
racism so.... And at the time it was weird.

00:03:14.563 --> 00:03:17.247
I was the only one whose parents were never married.

00:03:17.247 --> 00:03:22.140
Like everybody else's parents were together.

00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:24.958
or you know there would be like maybe once in a...

00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:29.295
a divorce but like literally my parents were never married

00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:31.776
interesting growing up.

00:03:38.576 --> 00:03:39.386
were like

00:03:41.428 --> 00:03:44.669
cause cause no like they..

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.182
Friends knew because I had like

00:03:47.182 --> 00:03:51.688
stepdad and I had a stepmom at that time because my dad got married to my

00:03:51.688 --> 00:03:54.202
step mom when i was like three

00:03:54.202 --> 00:03:58.793
and my mom got (***) when i was like six

00:03:58.793 --> 00:04:01.307
So by the time I got to school.

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:06.301
So I would refer to them as like, oh my dad, my daddy Tony, and my dad..

00:04:06.301 --> 00:04:09.136
or my mom, Diane, and my mom, Mary, yeah.

00:04:09.136 --> 00:04:13.963
Double the trouble. I'm just kidding.

00:04:13.963 --> 00:04:17.659
It was fun because it was like we had moved.

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:21.186
because i always wrote my mom

00:04:21.186 --> 00:04:24.629
You know it was rough because she didn't choose very well for her

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:29.623
so she was basically like the single mom because she was the stable one who was always working.

00:04:29.623 --> 00:04:32.137
Umm and

00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:35.731
Like we moved around so much

00:04:35.731 --> 00:04:39.191
But my mom always kept us at the same school, which was good.

00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:43.647
So but we like even though we don't it was always between like

00:04:43.647 --> 00:04:48.388
in south tucson or in like the southwest side so it's mainly stayed in that same area

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:52.709
Sometimes we would even move within the same apartment complex.

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:57.467
We went from a two-bedroom to a three-bedroom back to a two-bedroom.

00:04:57.467 --> 00:05:01.044
You could tell when times got tough, we would go into a house.

00:05:01.044 --> 00:05:06.039
she was by a house and then they have to foreclose like two years later so it's like a lot of movies

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.664
But like I said, she gave me that consistency of staying at the same school.

00:05:10.664 --> 00:05:15.051
And we always had to go to the babysitter afterwards because, you know.

00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:18.156
She is like that single mom, basically.

00:05:18.156 --> 00:05:23.150
It was crazy. And then I would go to my dad's house.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.284
And my stepmom loves to stay at home and be a stay at home mom.

00:05:27.284 --> 00:05:30.947
And it was just like, such a different like...

00:05:30.947 --> 00:05:35.183
Different dynamics felt like i was in a twilight zone over there, you know?

00:05:35.183 --> 00:05:37.697
But...

00:05:37.697 --> 00:05:41.916
I never really thought the team was always the center for me.

00:05:41.916 --> 00:05:44.481
home was my grandma's house.

00:05:44.481 --> 00:05:47.637
that was like my first house i wanted to but it's always like

00:05:47.637 --> 00:05:52.632
 no matter what, even like after I moved to LA, I would still get mail sent there.

00:05:52.632 --> 00:05:56.714
like because it was the only consistent place.

00:05:56.714 --> 00:06:00.512
and being at my grandparents's house was like..

00:06:00.664 --> 00:06:05.659
i felt free and it wasn't so like a older that i realize.. 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.455
There's so many issues going on in the house, but as a little kid, I didn't know.

00:06:09.455 --> 00:06:13.758
yeah yeah but

00:06:13.758 --> 00:06:17.995
Between my grandparents, there was like drama. I would have never known that.

00:06:17.995 --> 00:06:20.508
Yeah, it's like
