00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:22.577
Okay, Dim Sum, NBC.

00:00:22.577 --> 00:00:24.805

00:00:28.585 --> 00:00:31.807
Oh, so like south of the 10.

00:00:31.807 --> 00:00:34.406

00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:42.777

00:00:49.577 --> 00:00:51.787
Yeah, so it's like made to order kind of.

00:00:55.113 --> 00:01:00.107
I know, right? Yeah, I think they only do that like on the weekends, like on Saturday..

00:01:00.107 --> 00:01:02.925
mornings things they do the cart. But if you go like

00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:06.148
for the ones that I go to on Sundays.

00:01:06.148 --> 00:01:11.144
they just bring a like a paper and then you mark what you want and they bring it yeah

00:01:11.144 --> 00:01:15.885
Does NBC do that? The carts, like all the time?

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.728
Is that the place where there's like a market? Like in the in the opposite side of the...

00:01:28.728 --> 00:01:32.811
Oh, okay, okay.

00:01:41.856 --> 00:01:44.353
How's the price?

00:01:44.353 --> 00:01:48.049
Okay, or is it like on the more expensive side?

00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:53.770
Okay

00:02:07.743 --> 00:02:09.430
Like

00:02:15.252 --> 00:02:17.817

00:02:17.817 --> 00:02:22.035
20 some some bucks sounds like, really? That's crazy.

00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:26.996
That used to be really true.

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:31.941

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.970
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So everything's gone now.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.779
Yeah, so like when you go to Japan it like blows me away like how cheap it is like with like the exchange rate and..

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:46.774
everything too I had like a big meal of and like really really good like udon

00:02:46.797 --> 00:02:51.556
And I ordered like five extra things and it was like 1,200 yen.

00:02:51.532 --> 00:02:55.245
I was like eight bucks, right? I was like, ah!

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:01.321

00:03:03.852 --> 00:03:07.463
Yeah, really, really, it's crazy.

00:03:07.463 --> 00:03:12.137
So the same thing with like the... the hospital prices and stuff.

00:03:12.137 --> 00:03:16.964
like lately just because there's so many foreigners they're like charging a tax

00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:21.874
on all the corners for the umm for the hotels and stuff and they're like

00:03:21.874 --> 00:03:24.726
200 yen. Is that okay?

00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:27.543
Is that too much? You know, and people are like so...

00:03:27.543 --> 00:03:31.323
apologetic about that 200 yen you know so I was like

00:03:31.323 --> 00:03:35.205
That's like barely. Are you sure you don't want me to pay more?

00:03:35.205 --> 00:03:38.142
Yeah, because...

00:03:38.142 --> 00:03:42.023
I think so, but I got..i got charged.

00:03:42.023 --> 00:03:47.018
