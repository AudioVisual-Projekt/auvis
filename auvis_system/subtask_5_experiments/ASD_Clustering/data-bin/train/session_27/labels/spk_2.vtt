WEBVTT

00:00:20.726 --> 00:00:25.720
Yes, yeah, so I mean, it was fun going to an art school.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.818
I would say.

00:00:34.581 --> 00:00:39.524
yes yeah so there's like a application you have to submit a portfolio i mean i applied for visual arts

00:00:39.524 --> 00:00:44.200
But they have all sorts of works. They have even like culinary arts.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.891
They have like production design for like sets. Yeah for theaters

00:00:50.663 --> 00:00:53.986
I was in visual arts, so you know. oh..

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:57.767
yeah so it's like you can take classes in a lot of different things

00:00:57.767 --> 00:01:01.733
So I took classes in photography, ceramics...

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:06.711
painting yeah it was like it was fun

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:16.650
Oh, no, that's a funny thing. We didn't even have a mascot. We didn't have a football field.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.919
It's like in the middle of the city. yeah and the..

00:01:21.594 --> 00:01:25.407
Right, right, yeah. So even like our PE classes.

00:01:25.407 --> 00:01:29.998
We had like, I took tap dance for PE, which was fun, but

00:01:29.998 --> 00:01:34.570
For the students who wanted to take regular PE, they had to do laps around the parking lot.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.085
Cuz they don't have a field yeah

00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:40.225
Yeah, so I don't know why you would ever sign up for that is what I thought.

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:44.730
when you could take like Taekwondo or like ballet or something like fun.

00:01:50.856 --> 00:01:55.141
So yeah, so I'll you know cut it off there

00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:59.260
Yes, yes, but we did have problems but our..

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.326
Well, I guess maybe it's the same for other high schools, but our venues was always like

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.954
somewhere completely different. It would be like...

00:02:13.824 --> 00:02:19.712
But they did have like really nice venues for us like one time it was at the aquarium

00:02:19.712 --> 00:02:22.529
One of the school dances.

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.428
One time it was at K1 Speed, the big go-kart place.

00:02:26.428 --> 00:02:30.764
Yeah, like stuff like that. So it was kind of fun. yeah

00:02:33.296 --> 00:02:36.282
Yeah. Yeah, so.

00:02:36.688 --> 00:02:41.227
