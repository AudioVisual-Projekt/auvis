WEBVTT

00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:18.341
okay so about the

00:00:20.197 --> 00:00:23.792
Gamera's topic is kind of down and out. I could see that.

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:28.786
but we need to still talking about it because we need to finish

00:00:28.786 --> 00:00:30.086
this conversation.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.430
Two more sessions to go. Three, four, and five.

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:39.400
So I have a question.

00:00:39.653 --> 00:00:41.848
You know, Hawaii.

00:00:42.118 --> 00:00:47.113
Why did you, in that movie, the animation one?

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:50.419
So the guy you said you like.

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:53.171
He's the guy who was adopted.

00:00:53.171 --> 00:00:56.141
The male guy.

00:00:56.141 --> 00:01:00.579
who gets on the helicopter  who tried to escape

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.220
But he always ended up with kids. yeah

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.329
why

00:01:09.623 --> 00:01:12.812
So what makes you like that guy?

00:01:16.863 --> 00:01:20.794
You mean the same voice actor? oh okay okay

00:01:20.794 --> 00:01:24.609
But yeah, So that's why you like that.

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:27.494
The character that um... 

00:01:27.494 --> 00:01:32.490
in the movie that you like it's a voice person who's doing the voice for that

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.147
That's why you like that character. (***)

00:01:37.147 --> 00:01:39.678
So what about the other boys?

00:01:39.678 --> 00:01:44.657
or the other kids who are involved in that animation movie. How do you like them?

00:01:50.293 --> 00:01:55.085
oh he only wants the action part okay

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:02.847
yeah yeah so that's a small gals that's when

00:02:02.847 --> 00:02:05.936
The girls were trying to attack the kids.

00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:10.931
yeah yeah but they're little but they're bigger than humans

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:15.555
yeah yeah yeah and they were actually trying to eat people yeah yeah yeah

00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:22.101
yeah mm mmm Which that happened and that's why they were saved.

00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:24.903
Yeah  okay.

00:02:24.903 --> 00:02:27.687
You know all the Gamera's films?

00:02:27.788 --> 00:02:31.568
They always have kids involved.

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:36.108
and they are always the person who listens, Garnetta listens to.

00:02:36.108 --> 00:02:38.622
Yeah. So and.

00:02:38.622 --> 00:02:41.677
I don't know Gamera listens to adults at all. yeah

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:49.371
Well, I guess so. But more kids than adults.

00:02:49.345 --> 00:02:52.788
I wonder why that is.

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:59.412
Well, director? 

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:03.530
Well, maybe because the kids tend to have a pure heart.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.226
 Or they're honest and they're open.

00:03:07.226 --> 00:03:11.596
it's so maybe that's what the camera like  yeah 

00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:14.398
So I think that's why they are really

00:03:14.398 --> 00:03:19.324
(***) So I think the movie also wanted to...

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:23.037
say something  about what's going on just like the other you know

00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:27.441
the other movie that for god gojira they wanted to say something about the government

00:03:27.441 --> 00:03:30.564
Gamera wanted to say that.

00:03:30.564 --> 00:03:34.327
Kids are pure, kids are worth protecting.

00:03:34.327 --> 00:03:38.461
kids are very funny they try to they can

00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:41.398
and to take care of themselves and things like that.

00:03:41.937 --> 00:03:45.953
What do you think about the porch path?

00:03:45.953 --> 00:03:48.772
you know the

00:03:48.772 --> 00:03:52.113
real gamera There's a section that 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:57.580
The red little thing. What do you think about that?

00:03:59.217 --> 00:04:02.441
Good do you have anything?

00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:07.132
kids (***) oh (***)

00:04:07.132 --> 00:04:09.460
And the real movie.

00:04:20.227 --> 00:04:22.454
Baby gamera (***)

00:04:23.105 --> 00:04:25.507
oh okay okay

00:04:26.505 --> 00:04:29.272
When the baby camera came out, you mean the girl?

00:04:29.272 --> 00:04:34.267
neighbohood girl, Neighborhood girl you're talking about

00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:34.435

00:04:36.747 --> 00:04:40.308
oh the boy the main character oh

00:04:46.062 --> 00:04:49.909
Gamera I've only talked about it,

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:53.099
haahaa We're really running out of topic, aren't we?

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.918
but no no so my so let me go back

00:04:55.918 --> 00:05:00.541
When they were passing the little thing, the little red thing, the stone.

00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:05.536
From the girl who was in the hospital to...

00:05:05.536 --> 00:05:10.514
You know, I realized, 

00:05:10.514 --> 00:05:15.510
they were all connected because they're kids right  no one had to say anything

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.125
say anything. And somehow the first

00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:23.002
girl who picked up the stone from the girl who was in the hospital.

00:05:23.002 --> 00:05:27.524
kind of knew what she needed to do

00:05:27.524 --> 00:05:31.810
yeah they need to do they knew they knew what they need to do

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.274
and they knew where they have to go

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:39.696
yeah

00:05:41.413 --> 00:05:44.012
and then somehow and then that day

00:05:44.012 --> 00:05:47.082
they got it and then they kind of knew what

00:05:47.082 --> 00:05:51.673
they needed to do, which is look for the main boy. so

00:05:51.673 --> 00:05:56.414
yeah and then they finally got there and then the boy knew what he needed to do

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:05.459
yeah so and then dad

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:08.142
First time we realized what was going on.

00:06:08.142 --> 00:06:12.327
and then decided to help the

00:06:12.327 --> 00:06:17.322
help his son basically and then at the end he didn't make it

00:06:17.322 --> 00:06:17.492
