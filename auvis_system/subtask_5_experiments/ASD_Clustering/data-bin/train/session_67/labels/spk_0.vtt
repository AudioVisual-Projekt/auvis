WEBVTT

00:00:05.563 --> 00:00:07.621
Okay (***)

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.570
hai so (***)

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.669
So, Gamera is... I was telling you.

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:23.045
about that (***)

00:00:23.045 --> 00:00:25.762
I wonder, I wonder why.

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:30.621
Because you don't see tusks in regular salmon. Regular turtles don't have tusks.

00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:32.411
That was fantastic.

00:00:33.896 --> 00:00:38.891
Stomping turtle? Oh, snapping turtle?

00:00:38.891 --> 00:00:39.059
you

00:00:43.717 --> 00:00:46.214
A snapping turtle is the

00:00:46.214 --> 00:00:50.011
that (***)

00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:52.407
We're talking about R-Gated.

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:55.918
Irrigated snapping turtle.

00:00:58.203 --> 00:00:59.721
uhh

00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:03.038
So that was the model of the dummy.

00:01:05.502 --> 00:01:09.840
yeah The shrimping turtle is one of the vicious of all turtles.

00:01:12.354 --> 00:01:16.623
oh yeah they can bite off a lot of things

00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:20.505
yeah

00:01:22.107 --> 00:01:25.735
So but that's that's kind of where the idea came from

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:29.702
 I don't know if the snapping alligator snapping turtle had a

00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:32.536
(***)

00:01:32.536 --> 00:01:35.016
I'm a little dramatic

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.459
yeah

00:01:44.218 --> 00:01:46.508
yeah yeah

00:01:49.928 --> 00:01:51.632
yeah

00:01:53.411 --> 00:01:58.405
yeah yeah and then the well the animation one that we saw the cGamera

00:01:58.405 --> 00:02:01.679
Looks pretty mean but at the same time very kind.

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.194
Yeah, let's(***)

00:02:04.194 --> 00:02:08.007
And then people realized that (***) was actually to protect...

00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:11.500
yeah (***) yeah yeah

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:18.504
yeah yeah Just like that. Leveled.

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:22.351
but the other one is the real the the one that the real

00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:26.199
a movie like a real person one that also

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.489
Gamera was a bad one too.

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.265
The person one. The real person one. the Gamera

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:37.707
Then he was captured and they were taken to the building.

00:02:37.707 --> 00:02:42.669
Remember? He was taking his strength

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:46.178
It was brought all the way to town.

00:02:46.178 --> 00:02:49.284
(***)

00:02:49.284 --> 00:02:54.212
monster I wonder how the other monster knew

00:02:54.212 --> 00:02:55.578
Gamera work.

00:03:05.024 --> 00:03:06.675
oh

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:14.494
uhh it could smell it out (***)

00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:23.708
This little bit of a, they can sense each other.

00:03:30.173 --> 00:03:32.117
oh

00:03:33.327 --> 00:03:38.306
Yeah, yeah. So that they can attack. They can attack people from that far.

00:03:38.306 --> 00:03:43.301
Because Jamila was the only one standing in his way.

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:50.523
What's the monster eating people at all?

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:56.631
I remember now, I remember. When the little, the younger brother was saved.

00:03:57.458 --> 00:04:00.040
you know the scene that he came out

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.297
the town and I think he was eating people

00:04:03.297 --> 00:04:07.566
 I don't know why they want to eat

00:04:07.566 --> 00:04:09.507
people instead of other animals.

00:04:14.536 --> 00:04:18.518
Careful they decided to make his monsters eat people.

00:04:18.518 --> 00:04:21.810
(***) you're the one who likes it

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.303
have the monsters eat people too. 

00:04:25.303 --> 00:04:29.269
You got it from me, I'm gonna make my demeramos just like my dad.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:33.351
I am going to make my monsters eat people too.

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:41.299
yeah yeah

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.661
Oh, the animation?

00:04:49.416 --> 00:04:50.496
The real person one.

00:04:53.147 --> 00:04:56.015
okay Because I don't think he was.

00:04:56.015 --> 00:05:00.183
He was still growing. He's not a full size yet.

00:05:02.224 --> 00:05:07.219
He was still a baby. He wasn't a fully adult yet.

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.265
He got bigger, but not like a fully grown.

00:05:12.265 --> 00:05:16.046
He was not fully adult.

00:05:16.046 --> 00:05:21.041
And it looks like he didn't even know he could fly. yeah

00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:21.563
yeah

00:05:24.972 --> 00:05:28.618
It would be nice to have the sequel of that movie, but...

00:05:28.618 --> 00:05:32.296
well which never happened because that movie was made

00:05:32.296 --> 00:05:37.089
yeah it's almost 20 years ago yeah yeah

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:39.604
I think all the characters, they're all old already.

00:05:39.604 --> 00:05:42.354
So they have to use their new characters.

00:05:42.354 --> 00:05:47.079
I wish they could make yeah more Gamera movies.

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:49.931
That would be more interesting.

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:55.534
Because Gojira is so popular, Gamera is such a minor monster right now.

00:05:59.532 --> 00:06:02.755
yeah (***)

00:06:02.755 --> 00:06:05.709
(***)

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:08.426
because kong is like a protective people

00:06:08.426 --> 00:06:12.476
He wasn't like an out of control monster.
