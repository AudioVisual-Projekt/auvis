WEBVTT

00:00:25.062 --> 00:00:26.344
He bit the train, right?

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.644
Yeah he wedded

00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:32.762
Yeah...

00:00:35.378 --> 00:00:36.913
Yeah...

00:00:38.188 --> 00:00:39.858
Ahh...

00:00:41.623 --> 00:00:44.557
Ahhh...  Yeah...

00:00:45.894 --> 00:00:47.865
Yeah...

00:00:53.114 --> 00:00:54.930
Yeah...

00:00:56.146 --> 00:00:57.175
It can...

00:00:57.443 --> 00:00:58.480
Yeah...

00:01:01.943 --> 00:01:03.603
Yeah...

00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:05.073
Yeah.

00:01:06.176 --> 00:01:07.654
Yeah...

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:12.177
into the water yeah but then the  yeah...

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:14.513
Yeah...

00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:15.879
Yeah...

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:21.295
Yeah...

00:01:22.994 --> 00:01:27.804
Dramatic effect..   drammatic  effect...

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.435
Yeah, it's more like dramatic if they lift up and look.

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:43.649
Well, they sound like they're tanks attacking each other.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.574
a little toilet thing

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:59.293
Yeah... I guess they want to I guess you want to see

00:02:00.238 --> 00:02:02.295
yeah yeah yeah

00:02:08.203 --> 00:02:12.134
At least he noticed the text.

00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:18.343
Everyone died. I looked up that guy.

00:02:18.343 --> 00:02:23.338
And then he's just screaming.

00:02:23.338 --> 00:02:27.356
Yeah, that does also dramatic effect apparently. I loved it. I heard that.

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:32.350
That's like where they they get those like Japanese Japanese shows have that thing a lot

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.775
Yeah or like a play or something

00:02:35.775 --> 00:02:39.624
no no no no when the guy started screaming that kind of like like

00:02:39.624 --> 00:02:44.196
I guess you could say like overacting, but kinda.

00:02:46.914 --> 00:02:49.884
I kind of like that. Yeah... Yeah... Yeah...

00:02:49.884 --> 00:02:53.207
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's more for dramatic effect.

00:02:56.111 --> 00:03:00.178
(***)First of all, no one actually...

00:03:00.178 --> 00:03:03.822
Kind at, but they never say anything. 

00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:09.137
because they only talk and they only use hand motion

00:03:09.137 --> 00:03:09.374
to.

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:18.386
I think we're getting kind of off topic...  Yeah...

00:03:18.386 --> 00:03:22.131
Maybe but like I used to um sound so I think that's good enough for now

00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:25.787
Yeah...

00:03:29.185 --> 00:03:30.231
Is that how?

00:03:37.235 --> 00:03:38.196
I think so.

00:03:38.865 --> 00:03:40.369
Yeah...

00:03:41.105 --> 00:03:42.739
Yeah...

00:03:45.017 --> 00:03:47.144
Fills...

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.043
Ha, ha, ha...     hmm...

00:03:50.447 --> 00:03:52.118
He has a neighbor.

00:03:55.712 --> 00:03:57.891
Yeah...

00:04:00.337 --> 00:04:04.183
little girl, little girl, little girl,  I like the little

00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:07.151
Yeah...

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:14.242
Hmmm ...   maybe like one two yeah two two and a half

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:19.338
Kind at... She's just walking around.

00:04:32.551 --> 00:04:34.491
Yeah, he wanted to join that too.

00:04:38.878 --> 00:04:43.284
Well, at least it kind of worked. I mean, it was alive at the end.

00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:48.642
Yeah...

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:54.101
Maybe not, but he's in charge of the thing.

00:04:55.753 --> 00:05:00.260
Maybe, or like, something, I don't know, but something like that.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.099
I'll try that.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:10.216
I don't know. maybe alike ... I don't know...  I think it's a simple fact of physics and stuff.

00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:14.751
Yeah...

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.370
It was the pressure.

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:23.361
Yeah, I think so.

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.526
Avanti it goes to the bottom they would like um leave it

00:05:28.526 --> 00:05:32.154
And if they didn't die, they would bring it back up again.

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:38.109
Yeah...

00:05:41.061 --> 00:05:42.850
Yeah...

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:48.185
No  like that, deep sea creatures

00:05:48.185 --> 00:05:53.128
Standard can  living under D.C. can extend lots of pressure.

00:05:53.128 --> 00:05:56.436
So, once they go up a certain amount, the pressure

00:05:56.436 --> 00:06:01.161
and it blows up because of the pressure, they expand

00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:06.123
That's what happened to Godzilla

00:06:10.476 --> 00:06:14.104
Crushing death and then many burn 

00:06:15.101 --> 00:06:18.255
Maybe 1,560 or something.
