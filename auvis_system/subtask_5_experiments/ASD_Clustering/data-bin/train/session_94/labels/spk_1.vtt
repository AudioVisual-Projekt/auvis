00:00:19.444 --> 00:00:23.275
Ya assalam...I think I never thought about it before.

00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:27.475
But I think it is a combination, ballet is a combination of

00:00:27.475 --> 00:00:30.682
different stuff, just mixing and matching a lot of things.

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:34.090
i think yeah...

00:00:38.427 --> 00:00:43.423
just like the the recitals for the studio yeah

00:00:43.423 --> 00:00:43.557
you

00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:54.460
Ummm... I think... I used to...

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.125
It went to Tuesday. ... Okay...

00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:00.196
I mainly went to two studios.

00:01:00.196 --> 00:01:03.994
The first one I went to, I think it was like classic.

00:01:03.994 --> 00:01:06.592
What is it like? ammm...

00:01:06.592 --> 00:01:10.000
We did Nutcracker and...

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.995
We did like Wizard of Oz too. I guess it's not old. It's not classical to think of it.

00:01:14.995 --> 00:01:19.468
and Alice in Wonderland. The new studio I moved to, ...

00:01:19.468 --> 00:01:22.623
It's a Christian studio, so we always dance to.

00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:25.115
worship music... Usually...

00:01:25.137 --> 00:01:28.006
So, our dance is a lot.

00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:32.596
It's very classical and traditional but the music is like...

00:01:32.596 --> 00:01:35.313
Just yeah, modern music.... Yeah...

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.372
I think last year we did... Ummm...

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:46.367
Yeah, I Look To You by Stella. I don't think it's a very well-known song.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.964
Hmm...

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:58.060
Yeah I think something like that.

00:01:58.083 --> 00:01:59.366
I too...

00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:05.515
I don't think so, yeah. I hadn't heard of it.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.018
I heard it  before my teacher told me.

00:02:08.018 --> 00:02:13.012
So I was like, oh, okay. Yeah, it was, I don't know.

00:02:13.012 --> 00:02:16.792
It's really dramatic....  ha... ha.. ha...

00:02:16.792 --> 00:02:19.019
Ha...  ha... ha... 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.513
Hmm...

00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:29.488
Hmm...

00:02:35.035 --> 00:02:38.815
I think it mostly depends on the feeling of the body.

00:02:38.815 --> 00:02:42.357
But overall the default is smile. You have to smile.

00:02:42.357 --> 00:02:47.352
And you have to do it until like almost cheesy smile because then the audience can't see you.

00:02:47.352 --> 00:02:51.943
So if you just think you're smiling you're probably not smiling.. ha... ha... ha... 

00:02:51.943 --> 00:02:54.727
I love you guys so much!

00:02:54.727 --> 00:02:59.249
Yeah.. yeah.. yeah...  ha.. ha.. ha... Like we're trying to like 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:03.081
Oh, you have to smile too! yeah... steno like that...

00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:05.140
Yeah...

00:03:07.142 --> 00:03:10.483
Yeah.

00:03:13.088 --> 00:03:17.205
I don't know. They're both very plastic. I realized.

00:03:17.205 --> 00:03:22.132
Yeah, very traditional.  Yeah... Hmmm... I think...

00:03:22.132 --> 00:03:25.052
Ohh...  happy it turned into my major.

00:03:25.052 --> 00:03:29.136
but I like writing a lot too. Yeah.

00:03:31.847 --> 00:03:32.980
Hmm... I think...

00:03:33.118 --> 00:03:37.100
That would be really cool. I don't think I could do manga.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.303
I don't think I have that much artistic talent, but... hmmm...

00:03:41.303 --> 00:03:46.112
I've been doing a lot of short stories for my school assignments, but I think

00:03:46.112 --> 00:03:49.791
I'm interested just overall in the fantasy genre... so...

00:03:49.791 --> 00:03:54.549
Yeah, he's coming for that.

00:03:55.022 --> 00:03:59.358
My last short story was...

00:04:01.856 --> 00:04:06.850
Oh, yeah, the one I wrote last week, it was like the eggs...

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.535
like a full novel.

00:04:09.535 --> 00:04:13.263
I just wrote the beginning. I don't think I'll go further than that.

00:04:13.263 --> 00:04:16.285
But it was... I don't know how you...

00:04:16.285 --> 00:04:19.743
i don't think like i can size the whole idea

00:04:19.743 --> 00:04:24.130
I guess like these like magicians are encroaching on a kingdom.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.679
And then, only like, and then...

00:04:26.679 --> 00:04:29.193
The prince wants to fight back.

00:04:29.193 --> 00:04:32.433
but then his position to the throne is being challenged.

00:04:32.433 --> 00:04:37.361
So he can move the way he wants to, to protect his country. Kind of something like that.

00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:42.238
Yeah... ha...ha...ha...   Yeah... ha.. ha.. ha.. 

00:04:43.262 --> 00:04:44.615
Yeah...

00:04:46.255 --> 00:04:50.962
Yeah, yeah, yeah.          Yeah... ha.. ha.. ha.. 

00:04:55.164 --> 00:05:00.142
I didn't go that far. I only made the main character. (***)

00:05:00.142 --> 00:05:05.104
Definitely...  yeah...

00:05:08.205 --> 00:05:09.817
Yeah...

00:05:13.085 --> 00:05:16.680
Yeah, that would be cool. That's like a dream.... ha.. ha.. ha..  

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.127
yeah... (***)

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.269
Yeah, yeah... yeah... ha.. ha.. ha.. 

00:05:25.978 --> 00:05:28.594
Yeah....I'll put you on the cast list.

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:33.318
(***)   I'll definitely do that. Yeah.

00:05:33.318 --> 00:05:37.604
Yeah, yeah, yeah!  ha.. ha.. ha.. yeah...

00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:41.772
Aww, that'd be so cool though! Yeah...

00:05:45.452 --> 00:05:48.168
I don't know... I'm like a devil in a lot of things.

00:05:48.168 --> 00:05:52.354
So I don't know if I'm really...

00:05:52.354 --> 00:05:57.349
If I have a lot of skill in one of them, so it's kind of more spread out, I think.

00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:57.702
It's like

00:06:01.726 --> 00:06:04.055
I am sure...

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:08.386
  Hmmm...   hmmm... 

00:06:09.026 --> 00:06:12.080
Yeah, that is so cool.

00:06:13.313 --> 00:06:17.784
Thank you so much! I'm so encouraged!

00:06:18.156 --> 00:06:20.940
Yeah...
