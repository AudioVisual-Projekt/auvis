WEBVTT

00:00:28.217 --> 00:00:29.925
Allright.

00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:49.340
I think...

00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:22.173
There's like um... classical music is European. Yeah it's okay.

00:01:23.894 --> 00:01:28.888
I think um... Brazilian music is secretly really good.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:33.445
I listen to it. I think like, You know samba?

00:01:33.445 --> 00:01:38.439
And there's like... Yeah bossa nova and there's also choro with on a...

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.883
guitar. There are so many good guitarists in Brazil.

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.938
Yeah, it is. Yeah, It's creative.

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:48.650
And also lot's of um... There's lots of these like

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.379
Japanese artists that took from Brazilian music

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:54.909
There's like the instruments and stuff

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.281
And lots of those artists have really interesting music.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.031
like this one guy. His, his

00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:06.148
like Japanese jazz fusion but he's also uses like all these Brazilian instruments.

00:02:06.148 --> 00:02:07.650
And stuff.

00:02:08.112 --> 00:02:09.576
trees...

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:21.894
Is it the one that makes that weird sound? Like that monkey sound whatever?

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.079
Yeah, It's like hoo hoo hoo...

00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:30.649
Yeah. 

00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:32.338
That one's, that's fun

00:02:35.927 --> 00:02:37.676
como estas

00:02:59.878 --> 00:03:03.338
Is it like a, like a pie or something?

00:04:43.524 --> 00:04:47.591
Not really, but... I know, I know about it. I've like heard some of it but

00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:50.154
I don't really listen to it.

00:04:50.927 --> 00:04:52.613
It's too much like

00:04:53.117 --> 00:04:55.069
It use like um...

00:04:56.384 --> 00:05:00.519
I don't know, maybe the kind that I'm thinking about. They use lots of auto-tune kind of stuff.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.342
There's like a difference, like genre.

00:05:15.031 --> 00:05:20.019
They like kind of don't stop the note. They just keep it.

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:21.648
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
