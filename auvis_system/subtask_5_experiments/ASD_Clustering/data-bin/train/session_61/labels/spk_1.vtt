00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.730
I used to cook a lot in my 20s when I did a lot of the youth.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.201
like ministry, like I would always volunteer to cook.

00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:24.034
And God gives you talent when you're using it for Him.

00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:26.682
But, I'm serious, stop.

00:01:26.682 --> 00:01:30.310

00:03:04.793 --> 00:03:10.185
Let's say there's only one food you can eat for the rest of your life. What food is that?

00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:23.456
