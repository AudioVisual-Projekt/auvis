I'm okay with leftovers. Yeah. Especially... For how many times?

00:02:43.837 --> 00:02:46.335
But if you say...

00:02:47.127 --> 00:02:50.401
Yeah. I think. Um...

00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:53.927
But like... if it's like eating for lunch.

00:02:53.927 --> 00:02:58.585
And then like dinner, something else, and then lunch. It was in our mind for like two, three days, I think.

00:02:58.585 --> 00:02:59.512

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:11.409
