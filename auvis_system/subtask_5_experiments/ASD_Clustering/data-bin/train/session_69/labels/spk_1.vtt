00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:45.220
um  first trip i think i would change japan

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.980
Because I would kind of know how things go.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.958
completely new so I was wearing Japan wearing Japan

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.387
But then I think it would be like Kanagawa.

00:02:58.434 --> 00:03:02.248
Because I would know the way around the most. Yeah.

00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:10.532
Anywhere? I think I want to go to New Zealand.

00:03:10.532 --> 00:03:15.242

ohhh

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:38.402
Yeah, just a tour. I think that I would be happy with that.

00:04:40.223 --> 00:04:44.443
Oh, that's true. I think it would be like... How tall is...

00:04:44.443 --> 00:04:47.581
Hobbit? They're three foot something.

00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:50.636

No, he's not.

00:04:57.943 --> 00:05:00.609
Hobbit's point of view.

00:05:00.609 --> 00:05:04.828
oh but then yeah probably compared to the other like humans

00:05:04.828 --> 00:05:08.016
He's probably like around the seam or a little shorter.

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:11.256
Come to think of it, I don't know.

00:05:11.256 --> 00:05:15.088
But he's probably not the tallest person among the humans.

00:05:15.088 --> 00:05:17.028
He just wears the hat a lot.

00:05:17.568 --> 00:05:22.174
Elf is taller maybe. Yeah. yeah
