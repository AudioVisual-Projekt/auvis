WEBVTT

00:00:18.623 --> 00:00:19.950
yeah

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:22.762
yeah

00:00:23.348 --> 00:00:24.343
Yeah.

00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:33.641
Camera, camera. yeah yeahI don't know why you get confused between Goja and camera.

00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:36.341
yeah

00:00:36.341 --> 00:00:41.337
yeah yeah yeah but then they're both big and they're both monsters

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:50.669
yeah

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:53.604
Well, I guess it's because of the jet.

00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:58.515
because he has like a jet along with the spinning so when he can do that he can go (***)

00:00:58.515 --> 00:01:03.511
And then he can cut through everything

00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:05.401
yeah (***)

00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:09.016
yeah

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.922
yeah And then? But then like...

00:01:13.922 --> 00:01:17.618
But he can like, he has like two positions of flying. One is just regular spinning.

00:01:17.618 --> 00:01:22.613
And up there is kind of like an airplane. It kind of looks like a sea turtle.

00:01:22.613 --> 00:01:22.663
you

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.472
yeah

00:01:28.265 --> 00:01:33.261
No, his arm got cut off. No, this one.

00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:37.463
Oh, a hand actually, yeah.

00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:43.197
(***)

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:48.380
And it's in. Yeah, because the flipper just came out.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.375
Clifford just come out. Almost like he has back up arms.

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:57.494
I guess, I guess, I just don't see the point.

00:02:00.345 --> 00:02:04.463
Yeah, yeah, yeah. like

00:02:06.032 --> 00:02:09.559
Yeah, yeah, I think Will's the best. yeah

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:13.559
You know, if you think about it, he has armpit jets.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.330
yeah they come out from like around the kid under like like under like around like

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.843
Section between where his

00:02:21.843 --> 00:02:25.034
Like the flipper and the...

00:02:25.034 --> 00:02:30.011
Jet? With the flipper and the...

00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:32.746
the flipper and the shell connector

00:02:32.746 --> 00:02:36.711
Like, between those points, that's where the jet comes from.

00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:39.496
So it's kind of good. So you could say he has armpit jets.

00:02:39.496 --> 00:02:43.377
Yeah, yeah yeah

00:02:54.665 --> 00:02:59.660
yeah yeah imagine if they came out from wrong places like his mouth

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.331
I'm gonna come there for a moment.

00:03:05.488 --> 00:03:07.319
yeah

00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:09.976
yeah

00:03:10.578 --> 00:03:12.488
yeah

00:03:14.325 --> 00:03:16.908
Probably, but then...

00:03:16.908 --> 00:03:21.345
Gosh, it won't be that strong though. Gunman can just use the cutting thing.

00:03:25.521 --> 00:03:27.060
yeah

00:03:27.556 --> 00:03:31.487
He's actually a bit taller. Oh, depending on which Goja you're talking about.

00:03:33.175 --> 00:03:35.943
He's only 15 meters.

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:40.903
Yeah, original size. Camera at 60 meters in the animation.

00:03:40.903 --> 00:03:45.123
60 meters in animation I think. yeah

00:03:49.782 --> 00:03:51.905
yeah

00:03:54.241 --> 00:03:56.310
yeah

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:01.694
Probably, but depends on which Gojira, as I said.

00:04:03.313 --> 00:04:07.347
Yeah, we finally got that rolling downward. yeah

00:04:09.591 --> 00:04:12.797
Oh yeah, I think you'll probably win too. If you just cut the head off.

00:04:12.797 --> 00:04:15.648
Yeah, I'm coming out later.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.379
Yeah, well you can do it like you're spinning and you can cut through.

00:04:22.248 --> 00:04:22.736
Yeah.

00:04:28.255 --> 00:04:30.904
Well, I guess.

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:35.899
but then I don't know if Gojira was quick enough then I don't know he might have a chance

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:37.299
But it was amazing.

00:04:40.096 --> 00:04:40.945
yeah

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.231
I wonder where they got the idea of like...

00:04:45.231 --> 00:04:48.015
flying turtle like

00:04:49.647 --> 00:04:51.505
yeah

00:04:53.182 --> 00:04:54.721
yeah

00:04:57.246 --> 00:05:00.486
I like turtles, and then have the turtle.

00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:02.895
yeah

00:05:03.573 --> 00:05:05.328
Yeah, yeah

00:05:05.687 --> 00:05:07.306
yeah

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.049
But then like, as the... What was that?

00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:13.851
Uh, yeah.

00:05:13.851 --> 00:05:18.323
uh no no A little further after, I think. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:21.344 --> 00:05:26.339
I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not. I'm not really sure.

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:30.861
Like, I don't know who has the rights to Ghana.

00:05:30.861 --> 00:05:32.532
Yeah, I don't know.

00:05:34.186 --> 00:05:38.943
I don't know who has the right for that. But then, like, he can still be cool.

00:05:38.943 --> 00:05:40.597
yeah

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:42.562
yeah

00:05:43.315 --> 00:05:47.686
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, the tusks.

00:05:47.686 --> 00:05:50.368
yeah

00:05:50.368 --> 00:05:53.508
Yeah, let's go there

00:05:53.974 --> 00:05:55.194
yeah

00:05:56.477 --> 00:06:01.371
yeah yeah That's cool. You have really good tusks.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.327
yeah

00:06:09.208 --> 00:06:11.357
yeah yeah

00:06:12.323 --> 00:06:17.318
Yeah, no, actually, in the older movie, it's like Nagata actually...

00:06:17.318 --> 00:06:17.402
Thank you.
