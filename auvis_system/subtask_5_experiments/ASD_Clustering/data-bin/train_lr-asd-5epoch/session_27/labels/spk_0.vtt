WEBVTT

00:00:17.965 --> 00:00:21.541
So to continue.

00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:24.258
I did read...

00:00:25.137 --> 00:00:29.928
Ronan Farrow, he's a journalist. His book was

00:00:29.928 --> 00:00:34.265
Catch and Kill, it's about the rule of Harvard Weinstein.

00:00:34.265 --> 00:00:38.518
(***) on the background. He was doing a lot of research on it.

00:00:38.518 --> 00:00:41.032
So that was really...

00:00:41.032 --> 00:00:44.695
are fascinating to me. I love those journalistic in-depth

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:48.913
coverage right over here. Someone's going undercover investigating.

00:00:48.913 --> 00:00:51.782
So that was fun.

00:00:51.782 --> 00:00:56.608
Yes, it was a suspenseful you know read and umm..

00:00:56.608 --> 00:00:59.123
completely just not fiction.

00:00:59.123 --> 00:01:03.072
Right, and I also liked, it was a...

00:01:03.072 --> 00:01:06.767
Oh, what was that title called? Hidden Valley?

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:10.379
It was about this family out in Colorado.

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:15.374
And they contributed to the whole mental health wellness.

00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:20.368
industry because their family, she had like...

00:01:20.368 --> 00:01:25.364
10 or 12 kids. and umm but..

00:01:25.364 --> 00:01:30.240
About five of a hundred of them are schizophrenic. They are diagnosed with schizophrenia.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.838
medically. So that whole...

00:01:32.838 --> 00:01:36.737
They became this huge scientific study.

00:01:36.737 --> 00:01:39.251
just because of the nature out there.

00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:42.609
They wanted to test out the genetics of it.

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.507
(***) Schizophrenia.

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:50.641
That was an interesting raid. I forgot the title, I was heading that way or something.

00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:54.725
It sounds like Hidden Valley Ranch.

00:01:54.725 --> 00:01:57.999
But that was an interesting one. I could get your title for you.

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:02.758
My brain doesn't work as well as his.

00:02:02.758 --> 00:02:06.133
But stuff like that I find really fascinating.

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:09.626
Every so often you'll pick up one. That's a really good read.

00:02:09.626 --> 00:02:14.368
It's hit or miss though. Sometimes I get a little bored in midway.

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:18.807
and drop a book. but yeah

00:02:18.807 --> 00:02:21.422
