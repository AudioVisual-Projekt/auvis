WEBVTT

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:18.322
Okay, so (***) so you're talking about...

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:23.031
animation gummies or is that the real gummies?

00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:27.942
one of my favorite Gamera

00:00:27.942 --> 00:00:31.047
Gamera's monster? huh

00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:34.759
Well the most reason one that I watched

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:38.658
The one that comes in.

00:00:38.658 --> 00:00:42.387
and under the ocean (***)

00:00:42.387 --> 00:00:45.221
yeah yeah yeah it's kind of round you have that toy

00:00:45.221 --> 00:00:48.175
Yeah. Don't you have that soy? The silver one.

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:51.364
Don't you know the silver one? Ziggurat?

00:00:51.364 --> 00:00:55.904
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, (***) and there was (***)

00:00:55.904 --> 00:00:56.849
Yeah, yeah

00:00:59.279 --> 00:01:03.565
Oh, I like Gidon too. Gidon, the old one.

00:01:03.565 --> 00:01:08.154
They used to have a shuriken. Does it still have a shuriken too?

00:01:08.154 --> 00:01:10.669
Yeah

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:13.352
yeah yeah yeah

00:01:13.352 --> 00:01:16.119
They actually had it on the side over there, right?

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.114
Next to the eyes, they have a little shuriken thing comes out.

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:23.932
yeah but

00:01:23.932 --> 00:01:27.560
I don't think the sword was that sharp like in my life.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.357
yeah it was like it was like almost poking poking

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:35.373
and then kind of makes a cut and that's it but this new

00:01:35.373 --> 00:01:40.369
the animation one it was like yeah it was but

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.351
I bet that was one of your favorite Gamera movies.

00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:47.744
or the show is that with a little boy.

00:01:47.744 --> 00:01:52.012
Oh, the baby gun. The baby gun. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So.

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:58.644
That was a pretty good movie. yeah

00:01:58.644 --> 00:02:01.446
yeah so daddy

00:02:01.446 --> 00:02:04.923
So daddy lived in that town.

00:02:04.923 --> 00:02:09.901
since he was a kid, right? And then he was born.

00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:12.651
and the main capital was born.

00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:16.245
Or do they move there? Do they move there?

00:02:18.152 --> 00:02:18.894
huh okay

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:23.602
But he's that little kid what amazes me

00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:26.118
is that little kid is a great swimmer.

00:02:26.118 --> 00:02:31.078
He can swim from all the way to the island all by himself.

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.129
(***)

00:02:35.838 --> 00:02:38.958
But that far, it looks really far. I agree.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.676
(***)

00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:46.604
the baby (***) Which scene do you like the best of the movie?

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.122
oh

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.273
When he saw that knife, he was like...

00:02:52.273 --> 00:02:56.611
yeah yeah Reminding him of Giron.

00:02:56.611 --> 00:03:01.606
That was a little comedy, I think. It's kind of one of those what we call inside jokes.

00:03:01.606 --> 00:03:05.993
If they don't know anything about Gamera and Soda, they say, huh?

00:03:05.993 --> 00:03:10.819
but if you know the gamera then they'll say oh yeah you get it why yeah

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.620
What does that mean?

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.159
My question is how did the baby Gamera even remember that?

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:19.863
(***)

00:03:21.332 --> 00:03:26.058
Some kind of memory was inputted from the previous government.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.195
yeah So how do you like the monster that came out in that movie, Gummy?

00:03:37.195 --> 00:03:40.957
With the tongue sticking out. Yeah.

00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:47.455
other than just sticking to it but did he have any other

00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:49.598
(***)

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:55.724
then i am The sad thing is that they didn't make any more gummies.

00:03:55.724 --> 00:03:56.482
(***) movie. (***)

00:03:57.985 --> 00:04:02.980
I'm in a movie that's kind of connected to that movie.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.604
that's the only one that we know yeah yeah i wonder if there's other movie that

00:04:07.604 --> 00:04:10.118
same character now that they're grown

00:04:10.118 --> 00:04:12.969
(***) person  now (***)

00:04:13.122 --> 00:04:14.408
yeah

00:04:14.403 --> 00:04:18.386
I don't think so. but

00:04:18.386 --> 00:04:23.381
How much of the animation one did you see? Of the new one?

00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:23.551
you.

00:04:26.857 --> 00:04:30.706
This is the one that I showed you, right?

00:04:30.706 --> 00:04:33.540
Part of it, right? Okay.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.376
so (***) Gamera movie

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:39.953
That's the only movie you saw, the one with the words.

00:04:39.953 --> 00:04:44.948
Which older one did you see?

00:04:44.948 --> 00:04:49.066
with the uchuujin came like the space alien comes

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:55.090
okay so that was i don't know i don't remember much about that

00:04:56.929 --> 00:05:01.215
So why do you like Gamera so much?

00:05:02.583 --> 00:05:06.042
turtles yeah but that turtle

00:05:08.353 --> 00:05:11.812
You bring that turtle out, that's why you just gum it up.

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:15.643
because you like gojira too and then gamera too and then

00:05:15.643 --> 00:05:18.513
It's kind of all mixed up.

00:05:18.513 --> 00:05:21.093
So it's mixed because you like comment.

00:05:21.093 --> 00:05:24.114
The turtle, the Gamera turtle.

00:05:24.114 --> 00:05:28.586
And then Gamera is kind of resembling Gojira too. So it kind of...

00:05:28.586 --> 00:05:33.278
give you two two things that you like in one place

00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:37.648
So which monster do you like in that movie?

00:05:37.648 --> 00:05:40.838
Yeah, which enemy in general will gum it up?

00:05:43.336 --> 00:05:46.372
Byron? (***)

00:05:47.064 --> 00:05:49.865
Oh, the one that came on animation?

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:54.776
Yeah? Do you like it?

00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:06.285
