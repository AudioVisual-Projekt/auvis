WEBVTT

00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:15.150
Overload thinking...ha haa

00:00:15.106 --> 00:00:17.772
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah...  he is so funny.

00:00:25.686 --> 00:00:30.006
Oh, and he raises an eyebrow. Give him this.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.565
Is this your brother? ha.. ha.. ha..

00:00:32.653 --> 00:00:36.028

00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:40.039
Yeah, you don't know. Yeah, yeah.yeah...

00:00:39.995 --> 00:00:42.543
Oh,  He's never done this.

00:00:42.477 --> 00:00:47.472
sarcastic or anything in the Lord of the Rings.

00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:49.446
No tdrue...   Yeah, yeah.

00:00:49.556 --> 00:00:51.340
Ha, ha, ha...

00:00:51.404 --> 00:00:55.824
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah...

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:58.400
Yeah, yeah. yeah.. yeah...

00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:03.215
Keanu Reeves feet. (***)

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:06.270
Yeah...   yeah... yeah... 

00:01:06.473 --> 00:01:09.966
i guess i wonder if they were The chinese  to do that to show that he's

00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.784
May be...

00:01:12.784 --> 00:01:15.552
Of course he looks a lot older.

00:01:15.552 --> 00:01:19.484
I was goes to sixty six language   ha.. ha.. ha..

00:01:19.484 --> 00:01:22.571
Yeah, I miss him and then...

00:01:22.571 --> 00:01:25.085
But I'm like, mm, and then yeah, I'll do it. (***)

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:29.827
Everybody is quick. Yeah...

00:01:29.827 --> 00:01:34.165
We make for Guinnes Each otdher... It's like a masterpiece

00:01:34.165 --> 00:01:37.877
My father is each other thirteeth...

00:01:37.877 --> 00:01:41.624
I think the directors were talking about like strong power things

00:01:41.624 --> 00:01:46.618
They couldn't have tackled the 13 waives, so they went with Lord of the Rings first.

00:01:46.618 --> 00:01:49.133
Kind.. Yeah... Ha.. ha.. ha...

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.951
Yeah... (***)

00:01:53.148 --> 00:01:58.043
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah. You can tell each one of them apart.

00:01:58.043 --> 00:02:03.037
Lord of the Rings like yeah nine companions they're all like from different like like before

00:02:03.082 --> 00:02:05.782
Hobbits and elves and dwarves. It's a sleepier. .

00:02:05.737 --> 00:02:08.252
But 13 dwarves, they're all dwarves.

00:02:08.252 --> 00:02:13.246
and they don't have too much personality in the book so you have to work it from scratch

00:02:13.202 --> 00:02:14.502
Yeah.

00:02:18.715 --> 00:02:19.743
Ah hung...

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:24.739
Yeah, they're all doors, but different

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.271
kinds of tour. Yeah.

00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:30.882
Yeah,  that's why...

00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:38.188
Witch Dwarf is my favorite.

00:02:38.705 --> 00:02:41.203
(***)Hmmmm..

00:02:41.158 --> 00:02:45.360
I kind of thought I would like Keely the Archie.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.992
True they falls in love, Where is the else...?

00:02:47.992 --> 00:02:52.870
But I think overall I might choose Bolling.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.565
So grandpa, the oldest one.

00:02:56.565 --> 00:03:00.346
or something's been a good time for everyone. (***)  ha... ha... ha... 

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:04.023
Yeah... yeah...

00:03:04.023 --> 00:03:07.837
But he has such a passion though.

00:03:07.837 --> 00:03:12.394
Like some things he doesn't let go, he doesn't say no. Like he's stubborn.

00:03:12.394 --> 00:03:17.069
Like beyond logic sometimes. And you can see that.

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.848
so like oh that's very dork

00:03:23.778 --> 00:03:28.419
Oh, Beaufort!  ha... ha... ha...

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:32.289
Bedauforte... ha.. ha.. yeah...

00:03:33.684 --> 00:03:38.679
I think the one that gets closest to Bilbo. Next to Kong.

00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:40.019
Yeah...

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:44.609
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (***)

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.051
(***)Ha... ha... ha... I don't know

00:03:48.051 --> 00:03:52.927
Ha... ha... ha... No... ha... ha... ha...

00:03:52.927 --> 00:03:56.033
Yeah...  ha.. ha.. ha..

00:03:56.033 --> 00:04:00.605
Yeah... yeah... ha.. ha.. ha..

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:05.534
Yeah...yeah...

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.888
it.

00:04:07.575 --> 00:04:10.967
Yeah... Yeah... That's true...

00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:15.961
He's also the big brother. 

00:04:15.961 --> 00:04:17.751
(***)

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.795
oh yeah that's true ha... ha... ha...

00:04:26.795 --> 00:04:31.588
Ha... ha... ha... Actually, That's ..  that's true

00:04:31.588 --> 00:04:34.103
Ohhhh... yeah....

00:04:34.103 --> 00:04:38.170
on the table. He knows he's late but he wants one more drink.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.966
Ha... ha... ha... ha... Yeah...

00:04:41.966 --> 00:04:46.742
Yeah...  yeah ...this is so interesting

00:04:46.742 --> 00:04:50.067
I'm studying how to express character.

00:04:50.067 --> 00:04:54.792
And like little hints of things that they do that tell you who they are

00:04:54.792 --> 00:04:57.322
So this is actually a really good dissecting method.

00:04:57.322 --> 00:04:59.853
For me, maybe. We like it too.

00:04:59.853 --> 00:05:04.021
Ha.. ha.. ha... Yeah... yeah...Yeah... yeah...

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:11.514
Yeah, yeah, yeah,  so...  yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:11.514 --> 00:05:14.028
Yeah... yeah...

00:05:14.028 --> 00:05:16.999
HA... hA... hA...

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:20.677
Ha... ha... ha... yeah... yeah...   

00:05:20.722 --> 00:05:24.806
Ha... ha... ha...   Yeah...

00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:26.821
Yeah....

00:05:32.557 --> 00:05:37.232
Yeah... ha.. ha.. they     yeah...

00:05:37.232 --> 00:05:41.670
Yeah. Yeah. yeah.. yeah.. yeah...

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.860
Yeah...    They love meat.

00:05:44.882 --> 00:05:48.729
They love eating. And they don't let go. ha... ha.. ha...

00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:52.970
And they probably don't like veggies too much either.

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:55.244
Yeah...

00:05:55.324 --> 00:05:57.482
Uh..  Hmm...

00:05:59.907 --> 00:06:01.690
Yeah...

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:07.607
Yeah... ha.. ha... ha... yeah...  And they're very loyal to each other too.

00:06:07.607 --> 00:06:09.800
Yeah,...
