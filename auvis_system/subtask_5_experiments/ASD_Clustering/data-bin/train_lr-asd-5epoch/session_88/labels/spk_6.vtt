WEBVTT

00:00:28.337 --> 00:00:29.144
But wait...

00:00:30.814 --> 00:00:32.557
What got you into that?

00:00:36.648 --> 00:00:37.616
Like what?

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:53.959
Uh-huh, Uh, Uh-huh...

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.787
They are. They're not. They're like long time ago. Yeah.

00:01:08.392 --> 00:01:11.369
Yeah, yeah. It's nice. It's nice.

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:14.363
Yeah, sweet child.

00:01:15.034 --> 00:01:17.212
Sister, seriously.

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:18.873
Yeah.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.595
I actually don't listen to too much music. Not...

00:01:27.548 --> 00:01:29.015
I'm not!...

00:01:33.235 --> 00:01:34.330
I mean. 

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.160
Maybe this is like the past...

00:01:41.605 --> 00:01:45.215
Actually that's true. That's like, this is probably for like the past few months.

00:01:45.095 --> 00:01:47.730
This is true, I'm not listening. Cuz it's been a little like

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.244
crazy... but actually

00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:53.670
before then yeah, I would take my... YouTube. YouTube was my source of like

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.107
finding...

00:01:56.438 --> 00:02:00.394
Oh, yeah. I was all about it. Yeah.

00:02:00.314 --> 00:02:04.534
Oh, classical music by the way, yeah. It's final glory, right?

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.342
It's hard to say. Artist doesn't like player. You mean?

00:02:13.301 --> 00:02:14.606
Yeah.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:19.000
Composer, anyone. Anyone.

00:02:19.241 --> 00:02:21.680
I feel like everyone, anyone that's famous

00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:25.918
has a reason why they're famous because their music is a certain level of

00:02:25.918 --> 00:02:29.613
Especially if you think about it, it's like 400 years of music.

00:02:29.613 --> 00:02:35.213
400 years of composers and these specific composers are the notable ones.

00:02:36.634 --> 00:02:39.738
Seriously, so there's something in the music that...

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.599
You know, any piece of music that we commonly hear now?

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.155
There's something about it that you can like connected to it, right? Yeah.

00:02:49.155 --> 00:02:52.142
But. Artists, I think people

00:02:52.142 --> 00:02:54.774
I've met, actually, people I've heard live.

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:59.635
I tend to like like them more, because not...

00:03:02.643 --> 00:03:06.588
Also... Okay, go away, you brought a good point.

00:03:06.588 --> 00:03:07.973
I mean that in

00:03:09.271 --> 00:03:13.185
now, like recent performers, recent musicians.

00:03:13.185 --> 00:03:16.105
I need to hear them live before I feel like...

00:03:16.105 --> 00:03:20.576
And there's a certain like memory also with like the time you were there at the concert.

00:03:20.576 --> 00:03:25.403
Like my old viola teacher is probably one of my favorite violists.

00:03:25.403 --> 00:03:28.660
And... but also like old

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:32.711
Players from like the, the 1930s to...

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:35.337
1980s

00:03:35.578 --> 00:03:39.662
There's something very special about them that no one does now.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.424
We kind of talked about this, but there's like a...

00:03:47.424 --> 00:03:51.423
There's a specific like character to the music that played now?

00:03:51.423 --> 00:03:55.510
That wasn't a thing like 47 years ago.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.904
It was... It was more

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:01.634
very inner, especially after like

00:04:01.634 --> 00:04:04.705
in like the 1920s, like the war.

00:04:04.705 --> 00:04:07.893
There's so much focus on like the inner emotions

00:04:07.893 --> 00:04:11.051
of the human and like how did like

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.278
express what you feel deep down.

00:04:13.278 --> 00:04:16.500
stuff like that. So that like came out in the plain too.

00:04:16.904 --> 00:04:21.495
And they weren't all about like happy music. In like fame like, fair like.

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:25.343
You know happy. So that's more of a modern thing, like playing happy...

00:04:26.109 --> 00:04:27.043
like...

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:28.992
Yeah. 

00:04:31.957 --> 00:04:32.565
Yeah.

00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:40.842
Yeah, there's something so much more raw about the music, plain and simple.

00:04:41.286 --> 00:04:44.462
That is the music I listen to oldies and 

00:04:44.462 --> 00:04:48.815
some people, yeah, yeah. But mostly oldies section.

00:04:51.837 --> 00:04:54.823
I'm sorry. It's so unfortunate. Everyone.

00:04:54.823 --> 00:04:59.329
It's so unfortunate because I always only... I don't know anything other than...

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:02.957
School music is really so unfortunate.

00:05:02.957 --> 00:05:07.839
Yeah, which makes me, a really like bad conversationist when it comes to like

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:09.869
getting to know which one you listen.

00:05:11.042 --> 00:05:11.889
Music...

00:05:32.348 --> 00:05:36.174
I mean, I guess there's no specific like A7th floor that I like.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:37.922
But also...

00:05:38.647 --> 00:05:42.832
There's very specific moments of music that I like. So maybe if I like...

00:05:42.832 --> 00:05:46.610
find out the chord of that that would be my favorite chord i guess

00:05:48.424 --> 00:05:49.461
Oh, yeah.

00:05:55.285 --> 00:05:59.284
True. That's right. There's something about this chords. Yeah.

00:05:59.606 --> 00:06:02.724
Yeah... Yeah... Do you?

00:06:04.055 --> 00:06:05.782
I feel like, if you ask that.

00:06:07.368 --> 00:06:10.743
Exactly, it like bell it like a wall consist. Yeah.

00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:17.172
Oh...

00:06:20.396 --> 00:06:22.068
The piano? yeah...
