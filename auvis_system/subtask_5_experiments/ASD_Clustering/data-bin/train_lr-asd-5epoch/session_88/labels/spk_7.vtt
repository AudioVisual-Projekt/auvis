00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.966
So, what's...

00:00:32.414 --> 00:00:33.314
Oh.

00:00:33.454 --> 00:00:38.318
I think like some random YouTube video I found it talks 

00:00:38.631 --> 00:00:41.116
about like this guitar tone.

00:00:41.468 --> 00:00:44.623
And it said it sounded like the guitar tone from Cassiopeia.

00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:46.708
And I was like, oh, I'll listen to them.

00:00:47.021 --> 00:00:52.330
I was like, oh wait, I've heard of these guys before and like some videos about like we're Mario Kart

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:56.284
music come from, is like. you know. And then...

00:00:56.628 --> 00:01:01.079
Yeah.. and now they're like my favorite of all time band.

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:03.289
Yeah.

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:04.541
So good.

00:01:06.727 --> 00:01:08.410
They're 80s.

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:13.642
Yeah, back when music was all good.

00:01:46.343 --> 00:01:47.243
Yeah. 

00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:55.896
Yeah. 

00:02:04.714 --> 00:02:07.229
What's your favorite classical artist?

00:02:13.218 --> 00:02:15.703
Yeah, lyric composer.

00:02:58.298 --> 00:03:03.058
So you don't like classical artists? Cause they're dead.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.678
You like, like classic rock?

00:05:08.887 --> 00:05:12.870
Okay. What about music theory? What's your favorite chord?

00:05:50.163 --> 00:05:51.251
What?

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.339
Oh, I don't know what it's called exactly

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:12.759
But like it's like, it's like a, I really like it because it's in E chord.

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.526
But you don't even play the E in the right hand, you know?

00:06:15.526 --> 00:06:18.866
I always think that's like fun. It's like um...

00:06:20.894 --> 00:06:23.290
Piano. Yeah, yeah. Piano.

00:06:24.723 --> 00:06:25.844
