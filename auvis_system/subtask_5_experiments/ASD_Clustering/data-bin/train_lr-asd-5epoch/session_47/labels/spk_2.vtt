00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:48.602
The Korean War Memorial. Yeah.

00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:51.471
We hit all the other ones, yeah.

00:00:52.113 --> 00:00:57.073
No. Or do you want to go up more closer to the Washington Memorial?

00:01:02.407 --> 00:01:04.363
Okay, okay.

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.963

00:01:19.348 --> 00:01:23.787

00:01:23.955 --> 00:01:26.774
until  competition starts at four o'clock.

00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:30.110
Did you want to,Um...

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:36.579
Did you want to um...When you, um...

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.050
Did you guys want time to study in the morning or do you want to go sightseeing in the morning?

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.392
 we have like the whole day

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.222
Really?

00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:57.368
because we don't have time.... on the tail end.

00:01:57.368 --> 00:02:00.523
Because it's Sunday. We have that whole...

00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:03.461
Morning.

00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:06.583
and up till like 4 in the afternoon.

00:02:13.282 --> 00:02:16.386
We start sunny. Do you want to just go?

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.901
or get up early in the morning.

00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:23.862
go get, and,and that's where I was thinking we should go to the National Gallery.Then,

00:02:23.862 --> 00:02:28.148
And it's just an art museum, but I think three hours is enough.

00:02:29.312 --> 00:02:33.396
And then we'll go grab lunch.

00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:39.050
And,um.. after go grabbing lunch, we could...

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.598
Just go to...

00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:45.901
John Hopkins and find the space and just study for two hours.

00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:50.390
or so. Is that okay? So morning will do.

00:02:51.452 --> 00:02:54.072
Or would you guys get tired because the...

00:02:54.355 --> 00:02:58.878
Prelims are in the evening. Do you rather kind of sleep in in the morning?

00:03:11.331 --> 00:03:13.914
Yeah,you are right.

00:03:16.444 --> 00:03:19.044
Yes, the museum doesn't open until...

00:03:19.313 --> 00:03:23.853
I don't know, maybe he's museum like 10-ish, right? 

00:03:24.258 --> 00:03:28.932
Or we could do is, we could do...

00:03:28.932 --> 00:03:33.285
Instead of going to the museum, like the state capitol is right there.

00:03:34.383 --> 00:03:39.378
So we could just, we won't go inside the state capitol, but take pictures.

00:03:39.378 --> 00:03:42.028
Around the building 

00:03:42.212 --> 00:03:46.550
Walk by the White House.

00:03:47.242 --> 00:03:51.748
I don't know, would that be interesting?

00:03:53.974 --> 00:03:57.283
Okay. When did you go to the White House?

00:04:00.978 --> 00:04:02.396
Last summer.

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:04.366
Ho...

00:04:04.605 --> 00:04:08.538
Actually, the cherry blossom maybe.

00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:12.403
That be nice. Cherry blossom.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.010
Yeah...

00:04:16.165 --> 00:04:18.663
Like walking over there.

00:04:18.663 --> 00:04:22.646
Or we can also, but if we're gonna go there on 

00:04:22.646 --> 00:04:24.433
Sunday before we go home.

00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:28.991
Let me first call up the,Um...

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:31.961
the transfer. Did you like the...

00:04:33.176 --> 00:04:37.107
Taxi drive- not taxi driver.

00:04:37.107 --> 00:04:40.583
They were nice, right? That was a really good company.

00:04:40.583 --> 00:04:43.807
I think I'm going to ask them again.Yeah...

00:04:43.807 --> 00:04:46.540
see like the thing is if we're flying out of dc

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.679
See it Like, Ronald Reagan?

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:52.699
then it's great because,um..

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.935
It's like the airport's only 10-15 minutes away.

00:04:56.935 --> 00:05:01.930
So we don't have to leave so early we can maybe like

00:05:03.567 --> 00:05:08.141
Hang around Washington, D.C. to about three-ish.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:12.511
Right, but if we're flying out of Dulles...

00:05:13.557 --> 00:05:17.269
international which is 40, 40 minutes away.

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:20.324
then we have to...Um...

00:05:21.893 --> 00:05:26.045
We have to wake up. I mean, we have to leave earlier. Like

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.718
I don't know, like new-nish? No. Yeah.

00:05:45.485 --> 00:05:49.348

00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:53.163
Well, yeah, I have to

00:05:55.374 --> 00:05:59.458
Yeah, we need to figure out,um.. what exactly.

00:05:59.458 --> 00:06:04.828

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:25.242

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:34.102
