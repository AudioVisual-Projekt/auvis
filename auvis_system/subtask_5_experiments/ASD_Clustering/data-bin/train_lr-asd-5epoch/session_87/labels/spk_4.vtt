WEBVTT

00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:22.878
Sign off. Minor bach concert.

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:25.660
So yeah, 30 minutes long.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.266
Concerto, 30 minute long sonata, 30 minute long Bach.

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:36.261
Bach, bach suite. And, it's like

00:00:36.261 --> 00:00:37.878
It's a six minute showcase.

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.964
Classical music that's in the era or just like classical music?

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.271
Uh no, no um Bartòk is like

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.466
his written in 1949.

00:00:52.576 --> 00:00:53.458
And...

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.988
Yeah, yeah. He's 19

00:01:00.564 --> 00:01:03.399
like post-war, pre-war and

00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:12.947
Well, it's a little different for Violin uh Viola because there's so little pieces.

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:17.453
really like there's only three big concertos that

00:01:17.453 --> 00:01:22.161
Usually in one place. The Walton Concerto, Bartok Concerto, and

00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:25.486
Hindemith Concerto. And they're all around like the same

00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:29.536
like 1920 and after so

00:01:29.536 --> 00:01:35.006
So you kind of just pick and choose out of those three?

00:01:39.153 --> 00:01:44.149
Oh, oh, oh. much more. Much more. Much more. Cause, first 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.859
of all, there are...

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.142
So many more people who play violin.

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:52.400
But also so many more.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.396
It's so hard. There's that many people that are that good. It's hard to...

00:01:57.396 --> 00:01:58.356
choose

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.010
The actual ones you're excellent. So, I get accepted into schools or competitions.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.825
And so it's much more, I think, a bit more arbitrary.

00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:10.355
in my competitions and

00:02:10.355 --> 00:02:15.132
in violin world because there's just too many, so many

00:02:15.471 --> 00:02:16.787
Students.

00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:18.696
Yeah.

00:02:19.552 --> 00:02:24.430
Violin. Yeah. Also much more pieces for them, that's it.

00:02:25.074 --> 00:02:26.708
Coz we are mostly

00:02:28.013 --> 00:02:29.133
It was like

00:02:30.353 --> 00:02:32.851
Nine up like late

00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:37.846
18th century, early 19th century is when the viola started to become

00:02:37.846 --> 00:02:40.883
Not as like an accompaniment instrument.

00:02:40.883 --> 00:02:45.438
but like seen as an actual instrument for like solo playing.

00:02:46.383 --> 00:02:51.378
Yeah, it took a long time. Especially in like the Baròk era.

00:02:52.023 --> 00:02:56.373
I mean there are obviously with this many people in the world. There are people who compose 

00:02:56.373 --> 00:03:00.948
for viola. But that was like out of the ordinary. I don't know.

00:03:00.948 --> 00:03:04.609
It was not a normal thing to write from a viola coz...

00:03:09.712 --> 00:03:11.015
Mom is Viola.

00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:17.097
Yeah, But so I, I mean I started on violin, but when I was like seven

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:22.091
I saw Mona like win a competition, and so I was like, I want to win a competition too.

00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:26.496
And then my mom was like, if you wanna win a competition, do it on Viola.

00:03:26.496 --> 00:03:29.804
Because like it's less competition with Viola.

00:03:29.804 --> 00:03:32.486
Cause like I really didn't practice at all.

00:03:35.142 --> 00:03:35.719
No.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.290
I don't even remember playing violin.

00:03:39.342 --> 00:03:41.751
Like, if I, if I ran out, I don't...

00:03:49.378 --> 00:03:55.154
Not really. I really, I wasn't really into music at all. Even after I wanted to like learn for competition.

00:04:00.972 --> 00:04:03.128
I... I think it's like COVID.

00:04:04.316 --> 00:04:06.288
And the doc. like the story is like

00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:10.353
you know, better or not It's like Fujiko Hemming. Fujiko

00:04:10.353 --> 00:04:13.156
When I started listening to her and I got into like...

00:04:13.156 --> 00:04:16.929
piano music oh my gosh the ec oh my gosh

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.307
I talked for too long.

00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:23.868
That was cozy.

00:04:36.477 --> 00:04:40.358
Yeah, that was like 13, 14?

00:04:40.603 --> 00:04:41.452
Yeah.

00:04:50.602 --> 00:04:51.185
Yeah.

00:04:53.207 --> 00:04:53.953
Yeah.

00:04:58.312 --> 00:04:59.120
Oh my gosh.

00:05:04.765 --> 00:05:06.378
I even like came late

00:05:09.695 --> 00:05:10.374
Yeah.

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.073
Well, I don't remember being exactly like 

00:05:14.277 --> 00:05:19.272
Rude like in my performances. Because that wasn't like a thing I thought about being rude like

00:05:19.272 --> 00:05:23.541
performance. But she introduced me to like

00:05:23.541 --> 00:05:27.438
Very classic, classical music pieces.

00:05:27.438 --> 00:05:31.118
That eyes really like... It's like, wow, this is good music.

00:05:31.118 --> 00:05:33.869
For like the first time I think in my life.

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:37.563
And then from there I really started like, like, you know.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.172
Yeah.

00:05:42.323 --> 00:05:45.003
I was trying to play piano for a while.

00:05:47.975 --> 00:05:52.111
A little bit. But I never really stood out. I did it with Naoko for like a year.

00:05:52.111 --> 00:05:56.210
I did a CM on piano. I don't. I can't believe I did that.

00:05:56.957 --> 00:06:01.205
But, yeah. But...So I started with piano.

00:06:01.205 --> 00:06:04.193
Lots of piano music. I like it.

00:06:04.193 --> 00:06:08.986
Look at like all the pieces on piano, like ever. I tried to.

00:06:08.986 --> 00:06:13.337
And then, I think, from like...

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.498
After like Boston.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.051
I started...
