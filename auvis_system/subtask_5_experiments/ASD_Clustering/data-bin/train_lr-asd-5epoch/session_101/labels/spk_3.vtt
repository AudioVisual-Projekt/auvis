WEBVTT

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.630
Okay, two more sessions to go. Alright.

00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:13.897
Okay.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.584
So...

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.220
kind of changing, we're kind of moving along with the conversation back.

00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:22.695
Do you, I don't know if the rise

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:26.204
church has like a ministry tours like a

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:28.669
international, uh Japanese students.

00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:39.688
Okay, okay. coming from the attending the

00:00:39.688 --> 00:00:40.981
the school nearby?

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:44.517
Okay. And their are Japanese like...

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.592
Oh, yes. Okay.

00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:58.236
Oh... okay, okay. So do you hang out with them or talk to them? okay.

00:00:58.196 --> 00:00:59.178
Okay.

00:01:04.123 --> 00:01:07.160
I see, I see. Yeah, that's a different...

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.674
way but what you can learn

00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:14.569
more like you can speak to them in English but more of my thought because I do

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:19.175
hang out with a lot of Japanese students right now because that's kind of...

00:01:19.175 --> 00:01:21.891
What I, what I do on the side, or...

00:01:22.408 --> 00:01:25.638
So I have like maybe 5 or 6 Japanese students.

00:01:25.638 --> 00:01:28.474
That I hang out with during the weekends.

00:01:28.474 --> 00:01:32.305
And uh... you know. Talk to them about the Bible and things like that.

00:01:32.305 --> 00:01:36.085
Uh... What I learned from them is more of...

00:01:36.085 --> 00:01:39.222
But I do speak some Japanese to them but...

00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:42.109
You know what kind of thinking but

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.075
what kind of thoughts they have, what, what their worldview is like.

00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:48.588
You know, they're pretty open.

00:01:48.588 --> 00:01:51.947
in many things like when they come here they're really open to

00:01:51.947 --> 00:01:54.984
any religions, anything, so which is great.

00:01:54.984 --> 00:01:58.139
and... and they know that even though

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:00.907
Americans don't think we are, but uh...

00:02:00.907 --> 00:02:03.996
A lot of people think this is a Christian nation, right?

00:02:03.996 --> 00:02:06.983
They still have that idea.So

00:02:06.983 --> 00:02:11.100
so they, they open, like churches everywhere like you said.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.045
So they're interested to try to, you know, learn what the church is about. So they come,

00:02:16.045 --> 00:02:20.365
to church if you invite them, you know, and then so they come along.

00:02:20.365 --> 00:02:22.913
Oh, I want to check it out because

00:02:22.913 --> 00:02:27.890
they never do that in Japan, but they'll do it here, you know. So,

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.828
but being friends with those people...

00:02:31.265 --> 00:02:33.848
you kind of start learning how they think.

00:02:33.848 --> 00:02:37.711
How they, how they, what they talk about and stuff like that.

00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:42.336
So you can get more in like, touch of Japanese culture.

00:02:42.773 --> 00:02:45.017
Through them, you know.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:53.527
Um... So...

00:02:55.235 --> 00:02:59.352
So far this past month, so we haven't had Japanese students for like...

00:03:00.324 --> 00:03:03.260
like two years, three years because of the pandemic, right?

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.703
And then this past two years, they started to come back.

00:03:06.703 --> 00:03:11.141
Yeah. And then last year or this this September last September.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.656
We... have.

00:03:13.656 --> 00:03:18.571
So, me and this other people who's reaching out to Japanese students we met

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:23.646
20, about 20 Japanese students and they all go to Kansai Long Beach.

00:03:23.646 --> 00:03:28.302
And uh... So, that's where we kind of do the ministry in our...

00:03:28.302 --> 00:03:32.403
So we have one missionary who goes on campus.

00:03:32.403 --> 00:03:35.442
And they, they have this, what they call, language lab.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:37.995
and he volunteers there.

00:03:37.955 --> 00:03:42.326
And to speak you know how the international students practice 

00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:45.802
English, speaking English. So he volunteers there.

00:03:45.802 --> 00:03:49.060
And he makes connection with the Japanese students.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.092
And then from there, he invites people to different things.

00:03:53.092 --> 00:03:57.749
And then that's how I also met with them yeah and we also

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:01.800
um... host some of the Japanese for their...

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.921
I connected them to like a homestaying program.

00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:09.545
So, some of the believers are hosting Japanese students.

00:04:09.545 --> 00:04:13.241
So, so we, we go to their house and meet them.

00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:15.755
And to connect with them, hang out with them.

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:19.147
We do a lot of things like hiking or like different activities.

00:04:19.147 --> 00:04:22.944
So we can kind of become friends. And uh...

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:27.889
So, but anyway, so what I've been learning this past year...

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.538
They're, they're pretty open, like I said.

00:04:30.538 --> 00:04:35.297
They're open to talk about Bible they're open to talk about Christianity.

00:04:35.393 --> 00:04:36.307
Um...

00:04:36.495 --> 00:04:38.992
Some of them never been to church before.

00:04:38.992 --> 00:04:42.891
So, bringing them to the church kind of environment is a very 

00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:45.725
refreshing because they never experienced that.

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:46.833
Um...

00:04:46.992 --> 00:04:51.244
Most of them never had a Christian friend or knew, know any Christians.

00:04:51.204 --> 00:04:56.081
So... so we were able to meet with them and tell them about it.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.867
and they be, we become their first Christian friends.

00:04:59.867 --> 00:05:02.937
Right? So, and they're really excited.

00:05:04.606 --> 00:05:07.182
It's pretty cool because...

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:12.456
and then it's interesting the... You know. So our goal is not to bring much

00:05:12.456 --> 00:05:14.987
to church. Our goal is

00:05:15.066 --> 00:05:18.424
introduce them to Jesus. So,

00:05:18.345 --> 00:05:20.877
coming to church and stuff like that is kind of

00:05:20.877 --> 00:05:24.471
part of it, but it's not really the main thing. So,

00:05:24.471 --> 00:05:27.627
like relational, it really comes down to relationship.

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:30.680
So... we tried to listen to

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.427
what kind of thoughts they have, what kind of goals they have in their lives.

00:05:34.427 --> 00:05:36.942
You know. And but I

00:05:36.942 --> 00:05:41.937
I put like is that what you really want or you know kind of question because a lot of them...

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:47.690
Uh... their, most of them are pretty successful in a sense,

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.875
of like education you know they're actually go to that one of the really

00:05:51.875 --> 00:05:55.959
good schools in japan so and

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:58.524
and they're here so like

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:01.225
Their status in Japan is kind of really high.

00:06:01.225 --> 00:06:03.756
Not high high but in a pretty good position.

00:06:03.756 --> 00:06:07.401
because everybody will look up, oh, you went to America, you went to...

00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:12.074
and everybody kind of look up to them, right? So they have that little bit of a status there.

00:06:12.518 --> 00:06:13.312
Um...

00:06:14.314 --> 00:06:15.069
Oh.
