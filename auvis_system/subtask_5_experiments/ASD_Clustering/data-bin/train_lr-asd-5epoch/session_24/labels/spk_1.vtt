WEBVTT

00:00:17.035 --> 00:00:18.322
What are you saying?

00:00:28.814 --> 00:00:31.227
huh, no problem, take care for it

00:00:36.683 --> 00:00:38.007
yeah, may be

00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:41.813
yeah

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.076
But I think next time we go, I wanna have more stuff planned.

00:00:47.477 --> 00:00:51.241
 Cuz you know last time we kind of went like, no plan

00:00:57.602 --> 00:01:01.078
Oh, also, you decided last minute that you would actually go.

00:01:04.107 --> 00:01:04.829
yeah

00:01:05.235 --> 00:01:06.279
yeah ha

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.419
Because your work, you didn't know.

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:16.063
Wasn't it like you didn't know if you could get off early or whatever?

00:01:17.313 --> 00:01:19.400
***

00:01:19.557 --> 00:01:24.129
You know because when I bought my ticket, we were like, okay, maybe you might be able to work 

00:01:25.574 --> 00:01:29.277
That's that's this how I planned what days I would go.

00:01:29.598 --> 00:01:32.196
thinking that it's possible you might be able to do it.

00:01:38.372 --> 00:01:42.487
Then what was I expecting? And what was I expecting for?

00:01:42.407 --> 00:01:44.161
Is How would I know?

00:01:46.928 --> 00:01:51.434
No, but I'm saying I bought my ticket like a few weeks before, right?

00:01:51.434 --> 00:01:54.319
But I was expecting you to possibly be able to go

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.128
Was I expecting the strike? Yeah, so what was I expecting then?

00:02:04.393 --> 00:02:09.256
I think he was like, you getting off early, being able to leave a show early, or I don't remember.

00:02:09.572 --> 00:02:11.699
yeah yeah

00:02:12.595 --> 00:02:16.020
I thought it was already straight. Was it at Holland Harbor?

00:02:21.454 --> 00:02:22.768
That was already during the stream.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.556
yeah

00:02:37.416 --> 00:02:38.378
yeah

00:02:52.113 --> 00:02:54.106
I wanna wa I want to go to camp.

00:03:00.544 --> 00:03:02.275
Have you went to camp tour?

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:06.055
Oh, you haven't? I don't even know if I've been.

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.013
Yeah I don't know where we went. yeah

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:12.833
yeah

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.208
I think I we shouldn't go to the like village first and like places

00:03:27.844 --> 00:03:31.268
yeah yeah yeah

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.037
And I heard there's like a matcha shortage. A matcha shortage?

00:03:37.461 --> 00:03:42.808
But I think it's because of the foreign market like nor or foreigners

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.935
I think it's foreigners picking up and also like... Yeah, I think so.

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.900
yeah, but their

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.966
They are like limiting

00:03:59.183 --> 00:04:00.183
uhm

00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:04.624
It's like people can only buy like, yeah yeah,that's right

00:04:05.603 --> 00:04:06.296
yeah

00:04:08.087 --> 00:04:13.083
But It kind of sucks for Japanese people because when I checked the online stores, everything sold out.

00:04:14.264 --> 00:04:14.956
yeah

00:04:16.895 --> 00:04:21.890
I heard they're trying to keep the prices the same. It's just putting a longer

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:22.815
right time?

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.088
Yeah. That's what I heard, which I can kind of believe.
