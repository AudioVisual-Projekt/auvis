Exporting? 

00:03:48.974 --> 00:03:52.134

Yeah, mm yeah in Japan only yeah. Because you know, something like that happens here.

00:04:32.224 --> 00:04:36.280
Yeah you get scalpers buying as many as possible to sell for like

00:04:37.888 --> 00:04:40.364

And then you you know how you send me that thing where if you fly a JAL to Japan?

00:05:02.045 --> 00:05:04.427
Yeah, Domestic violence.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.692
And I'm sure there's limits, you know, because like, let's say like, go there for a month.

00:05:12.654 --> 00:05:15.266
And every other day you're like...

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.602

00:05:22.602 --> 00:05:26.280
Yeah, But how is expensive though?

00:05:29.116 --> 00:05:32.153
Okay, I have no idea about domestic, but as far as like

00:05:32.153 --> 00:05:36.506
Vice in Japan, they're the most expensive. yeah yeah

00:05:37.367 --> 00:05:40.775
If they're the most expensive, then A&E is the next most expensive.

00:05:41.695 --> 00:05:43.290
And then everybody else is stupid.

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:48.285
Yeah, cricket, yeah

00:05:48.285 --> 00:05:51.407
But when they have a good deal though, it's cheap.

00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:53.181
yeah

00:05:58.174 --> 00:06:03.169
Yeah yeah, it's a lot cheaper. It's always a lot cheaper that way.yeah
