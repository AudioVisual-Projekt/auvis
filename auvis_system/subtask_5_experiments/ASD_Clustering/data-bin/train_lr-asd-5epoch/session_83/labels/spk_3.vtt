WEBVTT

00:00:15.908 --> 00:00:16.756
Okay.

00:00:27.973 --> 00:00:32.496
Oh, that's a very long story, but I'll try to make it about a short one.

00:00:32.496 --> 00:00:36.731
So I actually grew up in Canada. I'm from British Columbia, from BC.

00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:42.118
I grew up near Vancouver, near the ocean, near the US border.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:44.272
So...

00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:49.880
And my parents are not from Canada. My mom came from Switzerland when she was 12.

00:00:50.356 --> 00:00:53.422
My dad came from Germany when he was

00:00:54.136 --> 00:00:55.116
nineteen.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.404
Yeah.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.590
Completely different things. So actually we still don't really know why my grandpa decided to move

00:01:05.624 --> 00:01:08.977
everybody the whole family with seven kids.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.856
um over to Canada when they had a pretty good life

00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:15.726
in Greece. When you were in Canada they

00:01:15.998 --> 00:01:18.581
I'm growing u, it costs so much

00:01:18.615 --> 00:01:22.834
It costs. So, you have to go in a boat for three weeks, modeling stuff right.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.415
But um

00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:29.448
uh went back for visits and a few

00:01:29.448 --> 00:01:33.060
We grew up and went back to live for a while, but they made me come back to Canada because...

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.326
The guys didn't want to go in the Swiss Army because it's mandatory.

00:01:38.143 --> 00:01:41.969
So like one of my uncles, he went deaf and he was deaf for a couple of years.

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.210
then we have go to Switzerland because their mind has changed.

00:01:46.196 --> 00:01:48.802
And same with one of the other ones too. So

00:01:49.517 --> 00:01:52.551
Yeah, that's how my mom's family came to Canada.

00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:55.436
And my dad's family, they were Germans living in

00:01:55.436 --> 00:01:58.102
Poland. In world war II. And after

00:01:58.102 --> 00:02:01.697
the war. Um there were Germans all over Eastern Europe.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.410
and they were all mistreated after the wars and all got locked up

00:02:05.274 --> 00:02:09.712
in  a camp. And then um they were going to end up in East Germany but

00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:13.002
we already knew that wasn't going to be a good place to live because it's communist

00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:16.513
they can't take a number. So then they got to West Germany.

00:02:16.513 --> 00:02:20.074
I had to go across the water.

00:02:20.108 --> 00:02:23.466
And then my dad, watching Germany, he grew up speaking with Germans.

00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:28.188
coz when we gets to Germany and the other kids are coming for you with funny accents, he stop

00:02:28.426 --> 00:02:31.479
You're like Polish people and

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.610
And he knew that the Germans had done this war, so he didn't really feel the effects.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.220
Like, wow, I don't really want to be associated with this country.

00:02:40.424 --> 00:02:44.255
As soon as he was old enough and learned. He had that mass.

00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:49.897
in Canada and he went and then about a year later the rest of the family

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.106
he offer.

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.561
That's a good question. Will my mom...

00:03:03.561 --> 00:03:07.425
They didn't have any ESL programs back in the day, so...

00:03:07.322 --> 00:03:12.420
They just put, like, they put her in grade one. I mean, they put all the kids in grade one. So which

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.560
She didn't like that, but 

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:19.221
she ended like finishing school like a year or two late just because they couldn't teach behind.

00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:22.945
um ... and... My dad.

00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:27.317
Well, he went to Saskatchewan and worked on his aunt and uncle's farm.

00:03:27.692 --> 00:03:31.050
and you don't have to learn English right away because they spoke German.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.526
He work from Germany. They ... um

00:03:34.526 --> 00:03:37.525
moved there like before the war, so...

00:03:38.274 --> 00:03:40.584
uh but then, eventually

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.246
Went to work at another farm when his rest of the family went over and

00:03:44.246 --> 00:03:47.350
Someone from another cousin of a cousin.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.806
came up from B.C. to visit. Um Some of their neighbors.

00:03:51.806 --> 00:03:55.349
something as, and offered my dad to come out 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.140
BC, British Columbia, which is the west coast, a lot nicer, better weather.

00:04:00.344 --> 00:04:04.429
And um he went out there and he liked it so much, he just said, uh

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:07.146
He told, and he told everyone else, you should all come here.

00:04:07.452 --> 00:04:08.350
So they did.

00:04:09.676 --> 00:04:14.335
So they're all there, they're all there now. So all my cousins, like my dad had, their family had six.

00:04:15.763 --> 00:04:17.945
So they're are all. They're all there.

00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:19.961
Looks like they have a lot of customers today.

00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:25.451
Yeah, the guy that had invited my dad to the party was Christian.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.117
He invited my dad to his church.

00:04:29.117 --> 00:04:32.204
And my mom's family had invited us in church.

00:04:32.204 --> 00:04:34.306
So they, that's how they met.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.026
And I actually think that, Yeah, my mom had also.

00:04:38.026 --> 00:04:42.177
they all work in the farm at the summer,  a lot of the teenagers go work on the farm.

00:04:44.023 --> 00:04:44.737
No.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.255
Yeah.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.125
Yeah, because by that time my mom went, my mom was

00:04:50.908 --> 00:04:55.120
Maybe I think they're five years apart. Something like that.

00:04:56.791 --> 00:05:01.786
My mom was 15 and my dad was 20 or maybe it was 16 and 21. Something like that and

00:05:03.778 --> 00:05:06.132
I have  two semester.

00:05:08.064 --> 00:05:12.820
I have an older brother, and then me, and then two sisters, and then a brother.

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:17.146
I'm number two. Yes. Number 31.

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:22.374
I grew up there.

00:05:24.163 --> 00:05:28.718
Uh When I finished college, I came down to Pasadena to do an internship.

00:05:28.753 --> 00:05:31.484
At a mission,  um office?

00:05:32.403 --> 00:05:35.031
And while I was down there um I never had

00:05:36.493 --> 00:05:40.012
Because um always um  it was a ministry that helps Christians get over

00:05:40.012 --> 00:05:43.741
The self-supporting missionary so they get a job in another country.

00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:48.091
and then you have a ministry. Just because someone lives in another country doesn't mean that they have

00:05:48.091 --> 00:05:50.605
This was more of a focus where. 

00:05:50.605 --> 00:05:54.081
These are people who wanted testing to have them in between another country.

00:05:54.081 --> 00:05:57.576
So, And then I help my husband go.

00:05:57.576 --> 00:06:00.473
a few and a couple years before they helped him go to Africa.

00:06:01.052 --> 00:06:05.266
So when he came back, he sort of kept in touch with him because the director.

00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:10.113
It was a woman who worked a lot with college students, student groups.

00:06:10.113 --> 00:06:14.990
like they study Christians and they look for family and intervene

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.695
universities, overseas.

00:06:17.978 --> 00:06:18.658
Okay.
