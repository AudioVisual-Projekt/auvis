00:00:19.548 --> 00:00:22.264
huhuhuhu huhu

00:00:22.747 --> 00:00:24.881
hobbies, yes

00:00:26.048 --> 00:00:27.918
I do, um...

00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:30.432
You know, it's funny because I.

00:00:30.312 --> 00:00:34.348
I've been thinking about what hobbies I should develop because...

00:00:34.348 --> 00:00:37.838
I feel like I haven't been really actively

00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.836
Passionately involved in a movie lately.

00:00:40.796 --> 00:00:43.229
I've been, ah, you know, I could say yes.

00:00:43.108 --> 00:00:47.847
I love to read, which I do, ah when the pandemic hit, um

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:52.295
I was reading a lot and I loved it because all of a sudden we had all this quiet.

00:00:52.214 --> 00:00:54.648
final match um I found

00:00:54.648 --> 00:00:59.788
got into um ebooks which I never did before. I used to go to library

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:03.490
or, you know, or um read, you know, like,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.233
In print and I picked up um ebooks and I loved it.

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:12.587
because I just felt it was so easy to...um

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:16.957
pick up only because um most books I never read twice.

00:01:16.957 --> 00:01:19.472
I never go back to it. so, um

00:01:19.753 --> 00:01:24.946
I am just kind of like to gloss around and if I don't like it I can always pick up huh

00:01:25.107 --> 00:01:29.377
I am so, um, that was fun for a while um ch I

00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:36.643
Not as a child. um, my sister was actually the avid reader when I was a kid.

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:40.954
ah and I would always want to play with dolls or something.

00:01:40.954 --> 00:01:44.986
Okay, I'm mad at her because huhu I wanted to um

00:01:45.228 --> 00:01:49.789
where where she would like to read, but I did major in literature in college.

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.385
So I finally got into reading later, I felt like, in life.

00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:58.431
and ahm I really enjoyed it, yeah, in life

00:01:59.025 --> 00:01:59.870
yes

00:02:03.582 --> 00:02:07.954
I was not, huhuhuhahaha

00:02:08.155 --> 00:02:13.110
Um, I was debating on what to major in and I felt in English

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:15.463
was a very practical major.

00:02:15.463 --> 00:02:19.850
I know lots of people are going into business or sciences and then an another thing spent

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.973
In terms of just um being able to kind like the wide

00:02:25.053 --> 00:02:29.388
I I think I want a wide range ah exposure to different things.

00:02:29.348 --> 00:02:32.860
like I felt I could study philosophy and religion.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.628
And, do you know science is pet?

00:02:36.715 --> 00:02:38.814
saying it's literature, it's reading.

00:02:38.895 --> 00:02:43.809
because you do get exposed to a wide variety of topics and things and so ah

00:02:44.051 --> 00:02:48.009
That's kind of what I ended up gravitating toward, huhu my

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.461
yeah,this it's developed into a...

00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:55.439
lifelong, I guess, love or, you know, just learning in general.

00:02:55.963 --> 00:02:56.918
scam

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:01.740
Right now, I have been, uhm

00:03:02.747 --> 00:03:07.354
What did I read last? I I remember I read Jimmy Carter's um

00:03:07.635 --> 00:03:09.867
No more? Uh-huh.

00:03:09.867 --> 00:03:14.862
ah before and I just fascinated by his life and developments

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:17.216
um humble conditions.

00:03:17.378 --> 00:03:21.174
and um went on to just do extraordinary things.

00:03:21.174 --> 00:03:24.616
And um so I do like biographies, if I could get ahead.

00:03:24.616 --> 00:03:28.801
***um I do like

00:03:28.801 --> 00:03:32.346
I try to expand sometimes. I tend to...um

00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:35.213
I think as I'm older and my...huhu

00:03:35.213 --> 00:03:39.281
My grandma's teachers were more non-fiction.um

00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:43.111
words versus before I used to.

00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:46.081
you know, want to pick up a fiction, a novel or two.

00:03:46.081 --> 00:03:51.060
But I still like and enjoy the occasional five star

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:57.080
ch

00:03:59.294 --> 00:04:03.499
oh, you know when the pandamic hit

00:04:03.378 --> 00:04:05.320
I think I was going for a 

00:04:06.407 --> 00:04:11.039
ah I mean, I don't read that quickly, so I I think I went through a good...

00:04:11.804 --> 00:04:14.093
15, 20 titles.

00:04:14.093 --> 00:04:18.364
that first year within that year was the first between pandemic.

00:04:18.968 --> 00:04:19.596
um

00:04:20.794 --> 00:04:25.788
but I usually don't read that much. I might go through a book.

00:04:25.788 --> 00:04:28.607
but till I might get into feces. hahuhu

00:04:28.607 --> 00:04:32.900
read for a while and then like put it down and do something else.

00:04:41.937 --> 00:04:45.161
Yes, yes. I do most of my reading at night.

00:04:45.523 --> 00:04:50.217
ah I'll turn into bed early and just lie in bed.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.273
That's where the inputs are great, because I don't...

00:04:54.273 --> 00:04:57.244
You have to put on a night light or you'll remember to turn it off.

00:04:57.485 --> 00:05:01.755
I just read them in the dark huhu on my phone.

00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:08.262
ch I have on occasion um been very, you know...

00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:12.585
I I usually catch myself and then I cut though.

00:05:12.464 --> 00:05:17.675
put down and then I'm done. Yes, it helps me fall asleep.

00:05:17.716 --> 00:05:20.918
