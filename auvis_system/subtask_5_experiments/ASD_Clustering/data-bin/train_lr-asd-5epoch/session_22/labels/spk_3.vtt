WEBVTT

00:00:19.575 --> 00:00:24.097
Okay, we are talking about how we came to Christ.

00:00:24.097 --> 00:00:26.865
For how did. Do you understand?

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:30.394
Okay, well, you know I grew up in the Christian...

00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:35.252
Christian home so Like I didn't have like that

00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:37.766
Defining moment, uhhh

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:41.781
I have Christ. It's just my I was used to going to church.

00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:44.449
from as from when I was a kid.

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.942
So from whenever I noticed, I was always at church.

00:00:47.942 --> 00:00:50.455
And so I grew up in church.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.763
Uhm, But I always.

00:00:53.763 --> 00:00:56.379
I now understand that I was always

00:00:57.458 --> 00:00:59.957
I grew up in like the warmth

00:00:59.957 --> 00:01:03.754
and christ, I think I was one of those

00:01:03.754 --> 00:01:08.275
so they are like Privileged like I didn't even understand 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.597
what I had so I took it for granted.

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:16.697
 So that was kind of it. And then, um,

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:19.295
But um...

00:01:20.722 --> 00:01:24.689
But like, as a teenager, I'd be better. And I'm like, nope. 

00:01:24.608 --> 00:01:27.396
 lot of things happened in that church that.

00:01:27.396 --> 00:01:31.024
I was just like, forget it. I don't even wanna.

00:01:32.313 --> 00:01:35.361
I believe in this, Yeah, because I was like...

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:40.355
we are like they're all Christians and they're supposed to be loving it. It was one of the worst places.

00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:43.562
But the meanest people were there.

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:46.480
Right? So I was like, yeah, I'm I'm not...

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.476
and then so I started doing part-time work on Sundays purposely.

00:01:51.476 --> 00:01:54.260
I would find a part-time drink, so. Sorry, Mom.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.633
I can do this since, I'm working, ahm

00:01:57.956 --> 00:02:01.956
No yeah So I was excited

00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:04.655
And I was like, no, this isn't for me.

00:02:04.655 --> 00:02:08.384
And so I completely kind of turned away from it.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.726
But when I, like...

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.865
was 17.

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:18.391
um, My dad lost his job.

00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:21.766
And I was still like, my dream was to go to college.

00:02:22.492 --> 00:02:25.453
and I just like I took it apart.

00:02:25.494 --> 00:02:27.925
myself oh my gosh, like I have to.

00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:32.515
do something and so I was working 30 hours a week.

00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:35.688
Um, Yeah, I'm going to.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:38.912
like high school, Yes, being a senior.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.345
um, so

00:02:41.324 --> 00:02:43.822
ah And then I completely

00:02:44.386 --> 00:02:46.573
My health failed, like I was...

00:02:46.573 --> 00:02:49.171
I developed like all these um

00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:51.985
Lumps.

00:02:53.288 --> 00:02:57.727
um, like underarm, So my mom was like,

00:02:57.727 --> 00:03:02.722
My mom freaked out because one time I asked her like this, it hurts here.

00:03:02.722 --> 00:03:07.581
under my arms. And she was like, oh, is it a zit?

00:03:07.581 --> 00:03:10.754
Huhuhu, it was charming at first.

00:03:10.754 --> 00:03:14.400
And then a week later, I was like, mom, this pain's not going away.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.387
And when she touched it, she goes, oh my god.

00:03:17.387 --> 00:03:21.032
It had grown like from a little...

00:03:21.673 --> 00:03:23.512
not to like it was about.

00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:28.591
Like a little smaller than an inch.

00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:32.915
the size of it, Yeah, like size like half of my palm

00:03:32.835 --> 00:03:35.206
So she's like, oh my gosh, and so we went.

00:03:35.206 --> 00:03:39.375
to the doctors and um they were saying okay let's see if

00:03:39.536 --> 00:03:42.968
you know, what's happening, and then the doctor was like...

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:47.608
after like series of tests and everything he's like no i think your daughter's

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:49.431
I was just way too stressed.

00:03:49.951 --> 00:03:51.402
and I

00:03:51.626 --> 00:03:55.490
and her body is reacting and

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.485
And it was because of old work and so then I had to get all these ah

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.139
Yeah smiled

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:06.509
But it was so painful though, but it was like...

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:11.577
My I had so many knots in my back and my body because it was just...

00:04:11.706 --> 00:04:16.483
I was tired and so that forced me to quit my weekend job.

00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:19.656
And then I had no more excuse.

00:04:19.656 --> 00:04:24.060
Do not, but i'm like okay i'm under my

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.865
Make my mom's juice.

00:04:26.135 --> 00:04:31.131
And so there was no option if you're not working on Sunday, then you need to go to church.

00:04:31.131 --> 00:04:34.607
And so I started going to church and I was still like...

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:37.121
disgruntled and like whatever.

00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:39.989
But the pastor at that church like

00:04:39.989 --> 00:04:43.313
coming like visiting here always sure

00:04:43.313 --> 00:04:46.376
So, How are you doing, Yasuko? How are you doing?

00:04:48.472 --> 00:04:49.457
yeah

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:54.147
Ah No, no, no, at my house. He would just show up.

00:04:54.147 --> 00:04:58.198
And then after a while, he just started growing on me.

00:04:58.198 --> 00:04:59.463
And then...

00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:04.828
I was about to go to college and I felt like, okay.

00:05:05.553 --> 00:05:08.386
I think it's about time, like, you know.

00:05:08.306 --> 00:05:13.116
And you see, this is where I became a Christian. I got baptized.

00:05:13.116 --> 00:05:15.967
But I really didn't know like I just

00:05:15.967 --> 00:05:18.667
I kinda felt the warmth again.

00:05:18.667 --> 00:05:21.181
And I kind of, okay, Jesus, like...

00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:25.383
In Word, I I always grew up with the Bible stories, so I'm like, okay.

00:05:25.383 --> 00:05:28.522
Okay, I believe Jesus died for my sin.

00:05:29.207 --> 00:05:32.217
But I don't think I really understood what sin was.

00:05:33.144 --> 00:05:35.373
Yeah, and then so I became

00:05:35.511 --> 00:05:36.478
um

00:05:37.465 --> 00:05:39.981
I got baptized, but

00:05:40.746 --> 00:05:43.979
Like there was no conviction. and

00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:45.733
that

00:05:49.126 --> 00:05:53.481
Yes.yeah

00:05:53.911 --> 00:05:59.268
Yeah, I felt the warmth and everything, but I just kind of felt, okay, my mom's a Christian.

00:05:59.268 --> 00:06:02.931
My dad is a Christian. My sister is a Christian.

00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:07.284
So, okay, well, I kind of understand and I know all the Bible stories.

00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:11.873
And yeah, I kind of believe that Jesus died.

00:06:11.873 --> 00:06:14.388
but I didn't really know what die meant.

00:06:14.388 --> 00:06:19.248
Um, so yeah, it was just one of those like
