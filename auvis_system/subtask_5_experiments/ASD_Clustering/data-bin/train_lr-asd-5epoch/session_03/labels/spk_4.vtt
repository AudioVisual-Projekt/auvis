WEBVTT

00:00:14.227 --> 00:00:18.800
Okay, where were we? Northern Lights, Alaska.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.314
Oh, you, you choose Alaska.

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:30.190
It's nice that we don't need a passport and all, so I would choose Alaska too.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.770
But I...

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.286
Yeah, true. That's true.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.211
I really liked Alask. I went to it once. I loved it.

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:45.689
I. We flew into Anchorage.

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:50.719
And we took a train from Anchorage to Fairbanks.

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:56.987
 Hm , like, uh, no it'was mid, mid winter

00:00:56.837 --> 00:01:00.838
Cause summer is too bright for... 

00:01:03.388 --> 00:01:05.285
What it is?

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.626
It was a lot of snow, so it takes like, if you take that train...

00:01:08.918 --> 00:01:15.327
and from Anchorage to Fairbanks normally is like three and a half maybe.

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.811
four hours at most on the train during the summer seasons.

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:21.069
but during the winter seasons,

00:01:21.153 --> 00:01:26.147
it's like 12 hours but

00:01:26.147 --> 00:01:30.653
Ah. But the thing is like during that season 

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:34.129
Um. The train only operates once a week.

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:38.812
but there's all these little towns in between. Um...

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.224
At anchorage and Fairbanks where they don't even have roads that 

00:01:43.224 --> 00:01:47.962
are accessible because of the snow so then the mail like

00:01:47.512 --> 00:01:53.536
They come on the snowmobile and then they hand out the mail to the...

00:01:51.864 --> 00:01:55.621
people on the train and then we pick it up and then

00:01:55.257 --> 00:02:00.729
along the way so the train makes a lot more stops so they can

00:01:59.915 --> 00:02:03.669
do the male pickup. Yeah.

00:02:06.174 --> 00:02:09.849
Yeah, Greenland, Iceland.

00:02:09.938 --> 00:02:16.517
Norway. Yeah, cause they're way up north.

00:02:17.852 --> 00:02:24.427
Iceland, yeah, it is.We g- . We're Greenlands. Is huge.

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:29.327
Yeah, Ice land, But I don't know if I want to do all of that.

00:02:29.327 --> 00:02:30.468
Travelering.

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:41.246
Ye- well  it's so no  up north and it has to be during. 

00:02:40.432 --> 00:02:43.587
Winter season or.

00:02:43.657 --> 00:02:49.402
Um, well, like October through March when the night gets dark enough. Yeah. 

00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:55.816
Oh yeah, it's Alaska, America, so.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.514
There are, but they're so...

00:03:01.272 --> 00:03:06.267
assimilated, ah, you know into, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:07.852 --> 00:03:10.006
Yeah.

00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:12.645
Yeah.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.152
But the thing is

00:03:16.273 --> 00:03:19.935
You have to really spend time with uh, family.

00:03:19.935 --> 00:03:22.978
because you only have like

00:03:22.737 --> 00:03:26.737
for three to four hours of daylight.

00:03:27.361 --> 00:03:32.304
so like it's not like minus

00:03:31.275 --> 00:03:36.271
30 degrees it's not like I hello. Let's go hang out outside, or you don't go

00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:38.212
out places.

00:03:40.446 --> 00:03:43.337
Hehehehehe.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:51.442
Ha. No, Alaska didn't have that many Gloucester. 

00:03:50.327 --> 00:03:53.652
but I could.... crash into the ice hotel.

00:03:53.652 --> 00:03:58.124
Haha! Slip on the ice hit my hand.

00:03:58.124 --> 00:04:03.855
But I don't even want to think about emergency in Alaska.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.684
i was somebody would know, right? 

00:04:14.206 --> 00:04:16.839
But, I would like to do Northern Lights.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:22.732
More so than Japan with the family.

00:04:26.056 --> 00:04:28.134
Really?

00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:35.165
You'd rather go to Japan than...

00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:53.141
Um... I it's four days is enough. 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.983
it's cause if you... Like.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:05:00.671
With the Northern Lights to be able to see it, you have to have luck.

00:05:02.384 --> 00:05:06.282
Longer is better, but if you can't see it, you can't see it.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:17.103
Um. Yeah, you know you should really look into the ear because the magnet like the field.

00:05:15.174 --> 00:05:18.297
have to be out there.
