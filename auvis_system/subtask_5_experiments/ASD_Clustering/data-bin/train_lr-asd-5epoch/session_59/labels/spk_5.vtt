WEBVTT

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:16.002
Ziyang is something else.

00:00:19.588 --> 00:00:22.101
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:25.274
Usually, but then like the new ones, they haven't been that good.

00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:30.294
Like... Yeah, the new empire. Yeah, Hollow Earth movie.

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:37.019
Oh, I guess... I guess... Yeah.

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.533
but there are too many too many kongs.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.189
Yeah. The beacon. The big kong. It is

00:00:44.308 --> 00:00:45.428
Yeah...

00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:49.340
Yeah... No, it was the hollow earth of ape.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.286
And then there's only one Godzilla. Did you have like a bunch of Godzilla?

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:57.590
But then that wouldn't really make sense. There's only like even like it's either like

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.069
Oh yeah...

00:01:00.104 --> 00:01:03.799
Frozen Godzilla? Which one?...  Oh no, that's that's shimo

00:01:04.636 --> 00:01:06.886
Shimo. Shimo.

00:01:07.953 --> 00:01:09.323
No, it's she.

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:18.350
No! It's the, It's the Ice Monster. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:18.988 --> 00:01:22.835
I guess, kind of. Okay, it's not. But then it...

00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:24.057
What?

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.113
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, kind of. But it's not Oompa Lu, it's Oompa Loompa.

00:01:29.113 --> 00:01:32.976
Oompa Loompa. But then, the real, the proper name for it

00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:37.009
no the proper name is axolotl axolotl

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.005
Axolotl. It's the Oompa Loompa. Oompa Loompa is Axolotl.

00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:46.342
No, it is...No. No, it is American, American name.

00:01:46.342 --> 00:01:50.830
Oompa Loompa. Yeah. Like that's like their actual name.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.901
No. Axolotl is a... is the... Oompa Loompa is Japanese name.

00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:01.444
Yeah, but then Axolotl is... Yeah, that's what I mean.

00:02:01.444 --> 00:02:03.711
so anyway so

00:02:05.031 --> 00:02:09.587
Yeah. By the way, so Godzilla. Yeah.

00:02:14.116 --> 00:02:18.455
No.I don't know, that's like, they said that's like from the, that's where the...

00:02:18.455 --> 00:02:22.252
All those tights tights, all those buttons.

00:02:22.252 --> 00:02:27.010
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All of their people. They, they would probably live in there. 

00:02:28.962 --> 00:02:29.812
Yeah.

00:02:31.728 --> 00:02:34.385
Yeah, but then the Muto always gets destroyed.

00:02:36.132 --> 00:02:37.207
Yeah. 

00:02:44.407 --> 00:02:45.362
Really?

00:02:45.362 --> 00:02:50.393
Oh, the Mothra? the Mothra? Yeah, Mothra, Mothra I like that. That was like the, the...

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.954
The Mothra... That is...

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.478
Yeah. So, yeah. Battra... Battra...

00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:04.118
It sounds like batter. But anyway, so Battra is the evil Mothra.

00:03:05.074 --> 00:03:06.869
Yeah. Evil. Yeah.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.762
Well, at the end, but then, like, at first, they were fighting each other.

00:03:12.226 --> 00:03:13.102
Yeah. 

00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:18.640
No. They don't have those. Only the... Only the...

00:03:19.143 --> 00:03:21.959
Yeah yeah yeah and then like the Battra

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:25.754
but like a evil monster that some people created or something.

00:03:26.073 --> 00:03:29.993
And... No, no, no, they didn't create it. What?

00:03:31.307 --> 00:03:34.742
Well, it was just evil, I guess. Maybe it was like an enemy of Mothra?

00:03:34.822 --> 00:03:36.931
But like... What?

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.931
I don't know, but it's but it's.. No, but it's still evil. I think they attack things and stuff.

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:45.885
so anyway but that...

00:03:46.728 --> 00:03:49.560
Yeah. Eventually, but that's because Godzilla came out.

00:03:51.471 --> 00:03:53.514
Yeah, but then Battra died.

00:03:53.514 --> 00:03:57.699
But I think Mothra didn't didn't die in that movie. No.

00:03:59.283 --> 00:04:03.693
The Battra, yeah. Battra. Battra. Battra, Battra.

00:04:04.131 --> 00:04:08.648
No. Battra. Battra. Yeah.

00:04:09.646 --> 00:04:10.602
Yeah. 

00:04:10.702 --> 00:04:11.578
Yeah. 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.674
Yeah. Well, at least thrown into the ocean or something. But anyway...

00:04:20.163 --> 00:04:21.328
Yeah.

00:04:22.483 --> 00:04:23.456
Yeah.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.736
Depends, but then... a... Yeah.

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:35.203
The original, it's the original. 

00:04:38.618 --> 00:04:41.944
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Like I...

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.134
Yeah, I'm at...

00:04:44.204 --> 00:04:45.200
Yeah. 

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:48.760
But then yeah. So, but then like the Shin Godzilla

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.469
Shin Godzilla, actually, I've noticed in the Godzilla movies that the Godzilla

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:57.029
Those with more personality are the ones that fight other monsters.

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:01.113
Did you know that? Like, like Shin Godzilla for a better one thing.

00:05:01.113 --> 00:05:06.394
It's just like going around destroying things, right? Yeah, but then it hasn't spawned any new ones.

00:05:07.867 --> 00:05:08.847
Yeah.

00:05:14.504 --> 00:05:15.420
Yeah. 

00:05:15.938 --> 00:05:19.550
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:22.237 --> 00:05:26.371
destroy destroy yeah but then like i like that i like that that's why i like it

00:05:30.982 --> 00:05:31.778
Yeah. 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.316
What do you mean?

00:05:35.385 --> 00:05:38.104
Well, because it was like... Yeah 

00:05:38.622 --> 00:05:42.286
I guess. That's what he does. And he goes like yeah, opens his mouth and he goes...

00:05:42.286 --> 00:05:44.003
swoosh... like that...

00:05:47.315 --> 00:05:51.914

00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:57.021
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. The back.

00:05:57.897 --> 00:05:59.667
Yeah. Like... like...

00:06:01.897 --> 00:06:05.339
Back. Yeah,  yeah. That was that that was cool too.

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:07.959
But he also tried from his tail. 

00:06:08.549 --> 00:06:09.465
Yeah. 

00:06:09.592 --> 00:06:14.080
Then... and then like. But then like. What was your favorite part about that?
