WEBVTT

00:00:37.927 --> 00:00:39.551
Okay. What?

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.720
Like you versus oh, wait.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.419
Cooking at home like stay cooking at home.

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:50.720
Yeah

00:00:58.346 --> 00:00:59.087
Yeah.

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:13.729
Yeah.

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:19.542
Yeah. Is it?

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.347
No, because we have to rent it out and it's a hassle

00:01:29.347 --> 00:01:30.399
What? 

00:01:31.646 --> 00:01:37.058
A-again. We could there's a little kitchen there. So but it's just like

00:01:37.058 --> 00:01:42.188
I don't if, I don't really like to deal with the homeowners association.

00:01:42.617 --> 00:01:44.158
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:48.111
They're pretty picky about a lot of stuff so...

00:01:52.497 --> 00:01:54.022
Oh, yeah

00:01:55.088 --> 00:01:55.674
Oh.

00:01:56.245 --> 00:02:00.007
I... I. You were there? Yeah. It was so really...

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:02.094
so...

00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:07.323
Yeah... And then we have Duncan's...

00:02:14.515 --> 00:02:16.406
Oh. Yeah. I think so.

00:02:24.393 --> 00:02:26.121
Yeah Like, I wasn't.

00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:32.864
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you were tiny and I don't know it was he

00:02:32.864 --> 00:02:37.774
It wasn't been born then? Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:39.217 --> 00:02:41.990
Yeah and after we had a little 

00:02:42.263 --> 00:02:44.338
issues... um...

00:02:44.642 --> 00:02:47.899
with um... somebody else username.

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:52.894
borrowed them and caused an accident in the parking for

00:02:52.894 --> 00:02:57.787
fooling around on their car and ever since that I was just...

00:02:57.787 --> 00:03:01.888
I'm like I told my sister I really don't want to.

00:03:01.888 --> 00:03:06.884
Because I have to live with the people that crash, right?

00:03:06.884 --> 00:03:11.879
And then... and they're upset with me, although like they understand.

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.592
Right, okay. Yeah, and they understood.

00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:18.999
I mean they took care of it and everything like insurance but it's a

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.767
hassle there and ever since that like...

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:26.542
making records probably if somebody complained about us so

00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:29.293
Yeah, ever since then I'm like, okay, let's try.

00:03:29.293 --> 00:03:32.499
Yeah I'd rather not. Yeah.

00:03:33.934 --> 00:03:37.242
Oh, well one of the guests that

00:03:37.242 --> 00:03:40.617
this person invited started to like

00:03:40.617 --> 00:03:44.953
Do wheelie type stuff in the parking lot to show off.

00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:49.374
And then I, I ran out and I tried to stop it.

00:03:49.374 --> 00:03:54.337
But before I got there, he crashed a car that was parked, a parked car.

00:03:54.882 --> 00:03:55.967
Yes.

00:03:56.147 --> 00:03:56.926
So...

00:03:59.299 --> 00:03:59.844
Um...

00:03:59.904 --> 00:04:03.618
It wasn't too bad because I mean he wasn't that good

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.756
Sorry, what was I saying? It's going really fast.

00:04:06.756 --> 00:04:10.737
high speed but still like I was like oh my gosh

00:04:10.737 --> 00:04:15.666
what do you say to someone your car was parked here but we crashed

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.134
So ever since that incident...

00:04:21.134 --> 00:04:24.509
I haven't really offered it to anyone. Yeah...

00:04:30.451 --> 00:04:31.410
Yeah.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.947
Oh, that's a good coffee.

00:04:43.154 --> 00:04:46.613
I definitely eat out more.

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:48.235
Yeah.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.111
I would say I only cooked maybe two or

00:04:56.072 --> 00:04:57.729
three the rest.

00:04:58.276 --> 00:05:00.293
is eating out. Yeah.

00:05:03.021 --> 00:05:05.211
Yeah. And like

00:05:05.211 --> 00:05:09.281
Yeah, I don't want to eat what my mom cooks.

00:05:11.463 --> 00:05:13.783
No salt, no sugar.

00:05:13.783 --> 00:05:18.406
nothing, you know, flavorless and it's all vegetables, so I'm like, no.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:26.658
Um... I usually take leftovers to lunch. Yeah. Why...

00:05:28.413 --> 00:05:30.134
I would never eat nuts.

00:05:30.134 --> 00:05:32.154
served at my school.

00:05:33.324 --> 00:05:36.985
Like I'm just like you know how we're pitching

00:05:36.985 --> 00:05:42.190
Healthy food, you know for the kids and I'm like what is healthy about what we said.

00:05:44.276 --> 00:05:49.271
Everything at recess is processed. Yeah.

00:05:50.687 --> 00:05:51.389
Um...

00:05:52.663 --> 00:05:57.336
It's really like...Um...

00:05:57.336 --> 00:05:59.853
Well, salad looks okay.

00:05:59.853 --> 00:06:04.846
But every like meat is like it looks really dried, overcooked.

00:06:04.846 --> 00:06:09.824
Yeah. It's just... I... I can't even describe it because I don't even...

00:06:12.085 --> 00:06:14.277
Yeah, exactly

00:06:16.882 --> 00:06:20.473
Yeah. So... mmm... yeah...

00:06:34.868 --> 00:06:35.838
Yeah...
