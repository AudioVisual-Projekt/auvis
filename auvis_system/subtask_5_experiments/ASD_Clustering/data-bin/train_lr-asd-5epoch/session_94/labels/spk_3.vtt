WEBVTT

00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:23.427
Okay, so you didn't see anything. So what happened was

00:00:23.427 --> 00:00:26.415
Godzilla can show it up, right?

00:00:26.415 --> 00:00:30.617
yeah he actually connecting  to the train and then he like bit it and then

00:00:30.617 --> 00:00:35.611
split into half yeah and then actually she the door

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:38.807
was saved because I think she moved

00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:43.390
From she's the only one who survived from the attack.

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:48.375
the rest i think that would destroy or something happened i forgot exactly what happened but

00:00:48.285 --> 00:00:52.233
But the thing was she was hanging on.

00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:57.178
to the train because I think the train cargo tilted.

00:00:57.178 --> 00:01:00.856
And because of the other

00:01:00.856 --> 00:01:04.721
You know, the way that Godzilla was holding, she was about to fall.

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:09.328
And then I think, but she was saved. She fell, but into the water.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.113
And then everybody was still running.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.740
You know, I always wonder though.

00:01:15.786 --> 00:01:19.431
Why people when this really really bad

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.626
character or the Godzilla come out, they stop and turn and watch.

00:01:23.672 --> 00:01:28.060
Yeah...   why do they do that?

00:01:28.211 --> 00:01:29.932
What do you mean?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.774
No...no..   They stop and turn and look what happened to the Godzilla when Godzilla is still attacking.

00:01:43.492 --> 00:01:45.051
That"s why

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:50.098
so just like your movie right tank comes out and then starts shooting

00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:53.321
and then they feel like oh the gazelle is gonna be defeated

00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:56.140
So all these people who was running away, stop.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.083
and then looks back and says, why do they stop? They should continue running.

00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:05.438
Doesn't matter what's gonna happen to Gojira or not, but what happened was...

00:02:05.438 --> 00:02:08.170
which is of course not dead or not hurt at all.

00:02:08.216 --> 00:02:11.186
and then start moving and all those people who's

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.136
Those people who were watching basically died because of that.

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:16.187
Thank you.

00:02:16.807 --> 00:02:18.298
Yeah...

00:02:19.185 --> 00:02:21.497
Except that guy, yes.

00:02:22.683 --> 00:02:24.691
Yes.... (***)

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:35.750
Really? Did everybody stop?

00:02:38.935 --> 00:02:40.629
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

00:02:42.067 --> 00:02:43.287
Ohhhhhhhh....

00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:46.832
I see, I see. When he kind of start crying and...

00:02:46.877 --> 00:02:50.387
Out loud and stuff like that kind of dramatic effect. Yeah

00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:56.118
Are you going to use that kind of type in your kasha kasha movie?

00:02:58.576 --> 00:03:00.517
No one talks in your movie though, huh?

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.558
They don't. So I don't know.. I don;t know  make...

00:03:08.368 --> 00:03:09.362
Ahhh...

00:03:09.393 --> 00:03:13.375
Do you think you're going to maybe use the...

00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:17.189
Ahhh...  Gojira talks in one of the kasha  kasha  movies.

00:03:21.193 --> 00:03:22.910
Okay...

00:03:23.147 --> 00:03:25.999
Well, going back to the minus one.

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:30.487
What about the place they were living? Those people who were living. Yeah.

00:03:30.487 --> 00:03:33.102
do you think you'd think you know were they

00:03:33.102 --> 00:03:37.945
Was that the original house that the guy used to 

00:03:37.945 --> 00:03:42.046
Oh, really? Oh, okay, okay. Oh, he came back, huh?

00:03:42.046 --> 00:03:46.518
and then realize his family and everybody else that he knew died.

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:50.080
or disappeared they weren't there yeah 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.868
so..

00:03:52.255 --> 00:03:57.100
except a very noisy neighbor who actually turned out to be very nice at the end.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.255
He was  able to even take care of that little...

00:04:00.277 --> 00:04:04.074
Girl. Was there a girl or a boy? A girl. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:04.052 --> 00:04:07.308
You like the little girl, she was cute?

00:04:07.308 --> 00:04:10.548
How old was she when the movie ended?

00:04:10.548 --> 00:04:13.384
Two years old? One or two years old?

00:04:13.384 --> 00:04:16.270
But she was talking already, wasn't she?

00:04:16.364 --> 00:04:17.584
No...no...

00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:22.310
okay yeah so what do you think about

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:25.185
the main character was cold

00:04:25.163 --> 00:04:28.149
to be part of this

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:32.536
group that's gonna try to destroy Godzilla.

00:04:32.536 --> 00:04:35.962
Yeah.. yeah.. yeah.. yeah....

00:04:35.962 --> 00:04:39.286
Do you think that was an effective message?

00:04:40.417 --> 00:04:42.269
Yeah...

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.995
Well, the main guy, the guy with the glasses.

00:04:47.995 --> 00:04:50.087
I guess he was a scientist?

00:04:50.794 --> 00:04:52.624
Ohhhh...

00:04:53.608 --> 00:04:56.657
Above he scientist up well...

00:04:57.207 --> 00:04:58.794
Was he an inventor?

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.072
because how do you even come up with that plan of like oh if you do this and do that

00:05:05.072 --> 00:05:07.130
Fujira might get exploded.

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:16.664
because what they tried to do was basically drown or pull the

00:05:16.664 --> 00:05:20.866
Godzilla down to the deep sea...    and then

00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:25.558
After he got certain death, they...

00:05:32.342 --> 00:05:37.337
Ohhh...  Okay...Okay, but they just but when they brought it up

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:40.525
That's where the pressure basically killed him.

00:05:40.525 --> 00:05:43.108
or supposedly killed him yeah yeah yeah

00:05:43.108 --> 00:05:46.263
So what happened? Was that exploded? Did he explode?

00:05:52.298 --> 00:05:54.105
Yeah...

00:05:57.928 --> 00:05:59.984
Hmm...

00:06:00.404 --> 00:06:02.776
Yeah...   Yeah...  Yeah...  Yeah... 

00:06:02.883 --> 00:06:03.877
Ohhhh...

00:06:03.931 --> 00:06:07.493
so they were so Godzilla was pulled down to deep enough

00:06:07.493 --> 00:06:12.217
to kind of experience that really really deep crushing death

00:06:12.217 --> 00:06:15.306
How many feet or meters was that? Do you remember?

00:06:18.563 --> 00:06:21.296
1,500 families.
