mmh

00:05:04.715 --> 00:05:08.579
uh for like nine days because we need to have a visa to go there but since i'm

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:11.785
I'm going there without a visa. I can only stay there for 10 days max.

Yeah. No Visa.

00:05:16.797 --> 00:05:19.295

Yeah, if you want to be over 10 days, you have to get a visa. And that costs a lot.

00:05:27.917 --> 00:05:32.198
and then you can only stay in one city coz you can't go out of the city. Yeah.

00:05:36.484 --> 00:05:41.637
Oh, that's. That's fine. Yeah, you'll need a visa though. Yeah.
