00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:15.147
Okay, where were we? um...

00:00:24.261 --> 00:00:25.015
Oh.

00:00:25.017 --> 00:00:29.203
My favorite Japanese food is tempura. I like tempura.

00:00:29.203 --> 00:00:32.359
and sukiyaki but I've hardly ever had sukiyaki.

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:37.592
I've had it at a Japanese restaurant once, and I think um

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.880
Yeah. I haven't had it very often.

00:00:43.492 --> 00:00:44.444
had what?

00:00:45.724 --> 00:00:49.756
Haah. I'm not sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:51.326 --> 00:00:53.975
Oh. Yeah. You have eat tempura with rice and you dip it.

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:58.853
And you let it drip in the rice and then it gives you more flavor, in rice.

00:01:01.907 --> 00:01:06.594
As you think sukiyaki. It's a little bit like Japan Chinese hot pot if you ever went on one of the

00:01:06.594 --> 00:01:11.256
Hot Pot restaurant were you get like three or two or three kind of soup.

00:01:11.256 --> 00:01:15.913
or... and you get food and you stick it in there. You let it cooked and take it out and eat it.

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:21.752
or you take out some of the broth and... Jackie's a little like that but...

00:01:22.942 --> 00:01:23.775
Yeah. 

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:28.639
Oh.

00:01:32.012 --> 00:01:36.094
Too dangerous. Go to Taiwan instead. It's better there.

00:01:38.355 --> 00:01:41.800
I'm hearing some bad stories that came from China right now.

00:01:46.035 --> 00:01:47.115
We got...

00:01:48.113 --> 00:01:50.175
It's a little bit, kind of an um

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:51.490
okay, it's just...

00:01:51.491 --> 00:01:52.364
it's...

00:01:53.038 --> 00:01:56.413
We'll see, but you're Asian, you'll blend in. So...

00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:12.613
Oh, by the way, that's not as traditional as other, they've sort of got their own culture, right?

00:02:20.082 --> 00:02:23.460
Oh. Really? Oh, interesting. It's like the San Francisco... um...

00:02:25.573 --> 00:02:29.370
No. All I know about it is we've had exchanges from Chongqing before.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.352
And we've had other teachers and they go, oh, people from Chongqing are so crazy.

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:35.614
Oh, but it's a great place to go shopping.

00:02:37.836 --> 00:02:39.394
I haven't watched any video.

00:03:04.706 --> 00:03:06.121
Chongqing

00:03:13.077 --> 00:03:15.573
The Jetson in the sky line looks like here.

00:03:15.573 --> 00:03:21.024
Have you ever watched that show, The Jetsons? Where they have all these ramps and things everywhere.

00:03:38.658 --> 00:03:39.806
Wow!

00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:17.635
Very strange.

00:04:29.318 --> 00:04:32.422
So they like stop working and dance like

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:35.943
Oh.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.716
Like dance their way over to your table and give you your food and dance away.

00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:44.279
mmh

00:05:00.553 --> 00:05:05.008
Oh, that's coming up. How long are you gonna be there for? How long will you be there?

00:05:12.582 --> 00:05:15.066
Oh! That's pretty short. Wow.

00:06:10.753 --> 00:06:12.903
What is your one main place where they go?

00:06:15.637 --> 00:06:16.232
Oh.
