00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:35.195

00:02:54.615 --> 00:02:58.971

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.389
Five weeks? Oh wow.

00:03:19.626 --> 00:03:23.156
From June? The whole month of June? Oh, nice.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:27.801
So you really have a lot of Korean food then?

00:03:33.954 --> 00:03:34.710
Yeah.

00:03:38.222 --> 00:03:39.436
Yeah.

00:03:41.168 --> 00:03:42.604
The chee...

00:03:44.567 --> 00:03:49.341
Oh, I'm not a huge fan of cheese.

00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:52.091
But they do have like deep fried cheese.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.674
Yeah, they take a stick of cheese and then they eat it.

00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:58.549
Yeah. 

00:04:06.423 --> 00:04:07.299
Yeah. 

00:04:08.057 --> 00:04:11.109
The corn dogs, right? The Korean corn dogs.

00:04:12.223 --> 00:04:16.191
That was a little too much for me. I- I like mine simple.

00:04:16.191 --> 00:04:19.530
Like the... in America, just...

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.632
Cornbread and meat. Have you had it?

00:04:23.632 --> 00:04:27.872
Have you seen Korean uh, corndogs before?

00:04:30.495 --> 00:04:32.350
Oh yes. Yeah.

00:04:34.266 --> 00:04:36.735

00:05:03.812 --> 00:05:05.089
Yeah

00:05:08.935 --> 00:05:10.663
You know actually

00:05:10.663 --> 00:05:15.608
that foodie you know like right now Japan has been kind of like a foodie

00:05:15.608 --> 00:05:18.526
nation. But I think that

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:21.514
culture really started with um...

00:05:21.433 --> 00:05:25.526
About the time the Iron Chef TV show came out.

00:05:25.766 --> 00:05:30.694
internet and then like that whole concept of celebrity chef.

00:05:30.694 --> 00:05:34.322
It became big and then like Japan really got into that.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.201
food culture and at the same time the anime came out.

00:05:40.317 --> 00:05:42.353
Like Oishinbo or

00:05:42.353 --> 00:05:45.610
like cliché or something about food related

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:50.134
And then just like, that food culture just...

00:05:50.134 --> 00:05:52.235
blew up in Japan but I'm...

00:05:54.586 --> 00:05:55.305
Yeah. 

00:05:59.646 --> 00:06:00.969
Oh, yes.

00:06:02.206 --> 00:06:04.375
Oh, yeah the... Yeah.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:09.689
mmh

00:06:24.338 --> 00:06:25.216
Yeah.
