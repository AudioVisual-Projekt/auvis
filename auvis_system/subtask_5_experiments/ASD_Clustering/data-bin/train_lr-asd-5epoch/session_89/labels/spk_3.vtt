00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:30.197
Uh... What's Hannah's favorite food? told it before...

00:00:33.995 --> 00:00:36.155
We never got to your favorite.

00:01:05.096 --> 00:01:08.183
California roll, I don't eat raw fish.

00:01:08.183 --> 00:01:11.956
I can't. I was really surprised that my kids love it, coz...

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:36.601
I love the taste of cooked salmon because we had a lot of salmon oak growing up because I'm from DC.

00:01:36.854 --> 00:01:39.351
And we had a neighbor that was a fisherman.

00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:42.203
And so he would often give us a whole salmon.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.663
And fresh, you know, like from the ocean so,

00:01:45.663 --> 00:01:48.363
I had a lot of salmon growing up.

00:01:48.363 --> 00:01:51.839
I just love the taste of cooked salmon. I couldn't get used to it.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.544
raw... to me when I

00:01:54.624 --> 00:01:58.589
tried raw salmon one time and  yet always didn't have same flavor to me.

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.452
Well, I guess it's one of those things you have to get used to in time.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:10.765
mmh

00:02:24.088 --> 00:02:29.065
Is this the one where they deep fry it in a batter or they just put bread, breading on it?

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:33.909
Does it have a coating on it?

00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:43.271
Yeah, I haven't had that thing. I haven't had it.

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:12.375
August, end of August.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.126
Oh.

00:04:26.955 --> 00:04:31.157
No, when I was there it was like 30 years ago or something, and

00:04:31.157 --> 00:04:34.587
they're all there eating like super spicy ramen and stuff like that

00:04:34.547 --> 00:04:37.652
I was only there for a week. I'm resting with missionaries to go work.

00:04:38.608 --> 00:04:40.662
They're british shake but I'm eating a little of 

00:04:40.433 --> 00:04:43.418
Korean food but, but like now when I

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:47.762
when I hear about don't go to the Japanese food. When I was in Japan.

00:04:47.762 --> 00:04:50.984
first time I was there was like 1982. And

00:04:50.984 --> 00:04:55.152
food wasn't such a big deal i mean you'd go in a cafe and they all had the same thing you could get just

00:04:55.152 --> 00:04:58.375
Curry rice or, you know, yakisoba.

00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:03.354
or whatever, or some restaurant and they'd have outside, you know, pictures of

00:05:03.354 --> 00:05:05.868
the noodles. This is 

00:05:05.868 --> 00:05:10.171
The bigger the noodles, the smaller, the smaller, the smaller. And that's all they had. You know.

00:05:13.073 --> 00:05:17.630
Right now. Yeah. That's kinda new.

00:05:38.926 --> 00:05:42.301
Anime really wasn't popular when we were there, that wasn't a thing yet.

00:05:50.398 --> 00:05:51.194
Yeah. 

00:05:52.798 --> 00:05:57.793
I used to have other shows because I remember when I was there they had shows like they had the guy from the gods must be crazy

00:05:57.713 --> 00:06:01.138
Come to Japan and you know, wearing the costume

00:06:01.098 --> 00:06:04.003
Maasai, whatever maasai or whatever it was. Or they

00:06:04.003 --> 00:06:06.904
or like my brother-in-law, they would do stuff like...

00:06:06.904 --> 00:06:10.719
they go sneak into this celebrity house and take his bed

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:13.233
and carry it outside really slowly.

00:06:13.233 --> 00:06:18.043
and put it outside, and without the guy waking up. It would take them like all night to do it.

00:06:17.963 --> 00:06:22.570
And then the guy would wake up and he's like, oh, they would do stuff like that, like like for a prank.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.508
and things like that. Because people didn't lock their doors.
