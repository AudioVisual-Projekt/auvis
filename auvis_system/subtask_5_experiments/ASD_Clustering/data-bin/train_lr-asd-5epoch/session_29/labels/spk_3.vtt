00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.913
haichi

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.741
Those are your staples, right?

00:00:53.017 --> 00:00:55.836
old town pass....Oh, Pasadena.

00:00:55.836 --> 00:00:58.822
I haven't gone to Pasadena too often.

00:01:08.644 --> 00:01:10.669
Yeah, 

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:20.795
Wait, isn't that one place that we went?

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:22.700
 with their head.

00:01:24.524 --> 00:01:27.054
okay

00:01:34.057 --> 00:01:38.360
I don't know, like I don't like sushi as much as I used to.

00:01:39.795 --> 00:01:44.739
I used to like it a lot, but maybe, you know, after coming back from Japan, the quality is not...

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:48.655
that I don't really enjoy it.

00:01:49.363 --> 00:01:53.262
And lately I feel like the fish quality is like

00:01:53.262 --> 00:01:56.197
The ones that you get in L.A. is just not...

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:59.640
up to par.

00:02:46.687 --> 00:02:49.928
During the pandemic, we used to buy

00:02:50.097 --> 00:02:53.573
Yeah, we used to buy a lot of meat.

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:57.150
from like restaurant suppliers.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.834
and like they will have it all like.

00:02:59.834 --> 00:03:03.395
in a truck and then you order it.

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:08.541
And then it was only word of mouth that you can do it because you don't advertise it.

00:03:08.541 --> 00:03:11.730
And then so yeah 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.566
Yeah, you can only. 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.074
Yeah, yeah, and then you go and then you pick it up.

00:03:27.745 --> 00:03:32.740
But we used to get our meat there because we didn't really like going to the supermarket.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.364
And it was so much better. And the quality was there.

00:03:37.364 --> 00:03:42.359
so we would get like mentaiko and hamachi

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.889
do there and then.

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.012
all of our meats, you know, and it was nice.

00:03:48.012 --> 00:03:50.711
We can't do, they don't do that anymore?

00:03:54.138 --> 00:03:55.841
Business as usual.

00:04:15.585 --> 00:04:20.580
The good old days.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.133
You know my son?

00:04:24.935 --> 00:04:28.647
But it seems like ages ago.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.686
Really? For me, like...

00:04:45.386 --> 00:04:48.273
I was wrong. and the cliche

00:04:48.273 --> 00:04:52.845
and it was like there's so many changes in rules and regulations.

00:05:06.633 --> 00:05:09.770
well i was alone for a while

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.479
Remember with all the whole house reform like my mom couldn't be there

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.275
during the renovation so I was alone for a good

00:05:18.275 --> 00:05:20.790
yeah

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.453
under the den and you guys said oh my gosh this looks like a

00:05:24.453 --> 00:05:29.448
like a mortuary wake or something like me sleeping under the chandelier

00:05:29.448 --> 00:05:32.772
Ha..ha..ha..

00:05:35.928 --> 00:05:38.931
But that, that's the part where like that...

00:05:38.931 --> 00:05:43.285
That time was stressful not only because of work, you know?

00:05:43.285 --> 00:05:45.140
and trying to adjust. It was like...

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:48.753
everything. Yeah.

00:06:05.645 --> 00:06:09.188
Oh my gosh, I didn't even know how to connect.

00:06:09.188 --> 00:06:13.474
I was watching YouTube videos.
