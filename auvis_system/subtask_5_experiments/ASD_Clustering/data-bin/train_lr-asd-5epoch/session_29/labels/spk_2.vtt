WEBVTT

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.204

00:00:18.204 --> 00:00:22.778

00:00:22.778 --> 00:00:23.739

00:00:28.246 --> 00:00:32.532
okay okay

00:00:55.347 --> 00:01:00.207
Oh, really? Because it's not so much obvious, is it?

00:01:00.207 --> 00:01:03.717
like career potential. yeah

00:01:03.717 --> 00:01:06.046
Oh yeah

00:01:19.056 --> 00:01:20.457
yes

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:26.059
Oh i see

00:01:30.261 --> 00:01:32.422
yes

00:01:34.884 --> 00:01:35.475
Oh

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:41.011
Oh okay

00:01:44.098 --> 00:01:47.237
Oh, did you enjoy it as a child?

00:01:47.237 --> 00:01:52.232
really okay

00:01:53.296 --> 00:01:58.291
were you taking piano lessons all the time or else when you were..

00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:03.032
Did you start when you were like? Oh my goodness, that is young.

00:02:03.032 --> 00:02:04.400
So yeah, wink.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.765
yes

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:17.325
 And how long did you continue?

00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:19.839
Or did your parents...did your parents make you?

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:24.717
play piano just throughout yeah

00:02:28.193 --> 00:02:29.425
yeah yeah

00:02:33.643 --> 00:02:36.682
okay

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.351
yeah

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:46.434
yeah

00:02:50.332 --> 00:02:51.920
wow

00:02:52.408 --> 00:02:55.430
yeah

00:03:02.062 --> 00:03:06.770
oh..

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.381
yeah i see i see

00:03:13.317 --> 00:03:17.722
oh wow

00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:25.585
Yes yes

00:03:29.027 --> 00:03:33.955
And that's what I assume because of your, you know, that you're saying.

00:03:33.955 --> 00:03:37.617
into music and your profession, that that is your hobby.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.618
almost assumed that you had this passion for ..

00:03:42.594 --> 00:03:47.589
or that you or that's what you do during your off hours too.

00:03:53.107 --> 00:03:57.664
yes yes

00:03:59.318 --> 00:04:02.474
oh that's so Interesting.

00:04:02.474 --> 00:04:06.557
oh okay

00:04:06.557 --> 00:04:09.071
Not at all.

00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:13.999
No I've never been to a piano lesson since I am like yeah i mean 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:18.994
They made you play the recorder in elementary school. That's sounds..

00:04:18.994 --> 00:04:22.082
I never went into bed, never did any of that.

00:04:22.082 --> 00:04:25.339
So maybe I just never even allowed myself.

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:28.512
objects for music. It was never something that.

00:04:28.512 --> 00:04:33.507
I had a keen interest in doing either, not necessarily

00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:37.051
Music is not necessarily something that I...

00:04:37.051 --> 00:04:41.945
hugely gravitate toward. I can listen to any type of music.

00:04:41.945 --> 00:04:45.522
But it ends up being more of the background noise.

00:04:45.522 --> 00:04:48.964
Like it's not something that I get super passionate about.

00:04:48.964 --> 00:04:53.436
So I guess it just never drew me in that way. although..

00:04:53.436 --> 00:04:58.431
piano is something that i always thought oh it would be nice

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:03.054
But again, yeah, never, never.

00:05:03.054 --> 00:05:07.375
got into that either. So yeah.

00:05:10.784 --> 00:05:15.779
oh..

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:18.090
oh nice

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:25.464
Oh..

00:05:30.308 --> 00:05:34.443
Oh really..

00:05:34.443 --> 00:05:39.269
is it..do you think any other...like it's hard or..

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:42.390
Oh, not the same way. Oh, wow.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.554
yeah yes

00:05:55.282 --> 00:05:57.392
oh yes

00:06:01.308 --> 00:06:06.303
yeah yes

00:06:06.303 --> 00:06:08.546
oh yes yes

00:06:10.842 --> 00:06:11.669
Oh right.
