00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:06.509
Pretty big policy changes. 

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:10.293

Yeah......um..

00:01:28.314 --> 00:01:31.385
Usually I look at the descriptions and if it's just like...

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:34.951
Oh they start from here to here then I know.not sure

00:01:35.357 --> 00:01:38.591

And then for animals, they also did.

00:02:18.113 --> 00:02:20.780
I think it was insects.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.453
they named like every single so it would be like butterfly but then there would be like

00:02:25.453 --> 00:02:30.448
All these other butterflies, like in the worms, like subspecies, they also

00:02:30.448 --> 00:02:35.257
asked about that on a championship round.

00:02:40.844 --> 00:02:44.320
Which of these animals are native?

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.690
it's like our native to Japan and it was like Irish

00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:52.286
Probably,name it and then

00:02:52.268 --> 00:02:56.978
