00:02:12.212 --> 00:02:17.207
It's like a, it almost looks like a gourd and it's like a big, like

Like strings. Yeah.

00:04:05.714 --> 00:04:07.375

00:04:13.105 --> 00:04:17.172
what is it called how they

00:04:17.172 --> 00:04:21.643
the eastern style like the melodic scale?... is

00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:26.638
Yeah. I love the way that sounds... at

00:04:39.661 --> 00:04:43.879

Me and my friend when I was driving over here we were talking about

00:05:29.684 --> 00:05:34.358
autotunes and we were talking about like the old school youtube videos that had

00:05:34.358 --> 00:05:37.507
auto-tunes like um... re...

00:05:38.526 --> 00:05:42.272
Remember that guy who was like, hide your wives, hide your kids, hide your husbands.

00:05:42.272 --> 00:05:44.921
And they did this whole auto-tune to it.

00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:48.601
Like from years ago. Oh my gosh, that's so funny.

00:05:50.447 --> 00:05:52.853
So funny they would take like these

00:05:52.814 --> 00:05:56.430
um... viral videos from YouTube and they would auto-tune it.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.332
It's so funny. Yeah, yeah.

00:05:59.332 --> 00:06:02.000
