WEBVTT

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:28.986
Um...

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.145
Yeah, this is weird. Japanese.

00:00:33.235 --> 00:00:34.454
Kind of.

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:37.759
Yeah. 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.962
Ooh...

00:01:00.264 --> 00:01:01.278
Ha!

00:01:03.213 --> 00:01:04.236
Yes.

00:01:08.864 --> 00:01:10.514
Which city are you in?

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:13.156
Aaah. Okay.

00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:16.087
I don't really know.

00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:19.650
mmh

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:24.467
Oh. Wow.

00:01:31.983 --> 00:01:36.201
Pork? What about like, Boba or something?

00:01:40.234 --> 00:01:45.965
Yeah. I thought it is. Yeah. Because my friend is telling me all about how there are Boba's and Pearls

00:01:46.162 --> 00:01:48.817
So good. Yeah.

00:01:51.108 --> 00:01:54.635
They got famous really here. Boba.

00:01:54.727 --> 00:01:55.710
really?

00:01:59.302 --> 00:02:01.121
I know, right?

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:05.918
That's true. If it's too true, I don't get it. But also...

00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:07.685
When I first saw it...

00:02:09.242 --> 00:02:12.729
It's really real? Oh, I can't eat it. I can't.

00:02:12.808 --> 00:02:15.992
When I first was introduced to the

00:02:15.992 --> 00:02:19.873
Boba Pearls. My, my siblings told me that um...

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:24.564
Like frog eyes or something. Frog eggs. It was something disgusting.

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:27.333
I.

00:02:28.063 --> 00:02:30.515
I know. I wasn't able to, but...

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:41.508
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like for real. I can't...

00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:47.218
Yeah. I know. What happened to Nemo?

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:52.720
It looks like

00:02:56.864 --> 00:03:01.021
Well, they can be bigger, like...  Like, equally...

00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:04.159
The boba is so little.

00:03:19.003 --> 00:03:23.166
Really good to eat? If it's really good, I would wait for...

00:03:24.622 --> 00:03:26.935
Like one hour probably.

00:03:26.935 --> 00:03:29.669
But if it's just like a little bit.

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.618
I would not wait longer than 20 minutes.

00:03:34.231 --> 00:03:35.057
Yeah. 

00:03:35.175 --> 00:03:36.446
How long you would wait?

00:03:40.131 --> 00:03:44.063
Yeah. It's like a Disneyland ride.

00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:54.777
Oh. Wow.

00:03:55.727 --> 00:03:56.632
Hah!

00:03:57.352 --> 00:03:58.768
Oh...

00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:01.241
Oh my gosh, and then hold.

00:04:05.073 --> 00:04:08.379
What was that? I remember there was a...

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.852
I went to the, it was at the top floor of a mall and it was this

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:16.969
Special place for Udon. Which is like... tong tong something.

00:04:17.205 --> 00:04:18.542
the udon.

00:04:18.795 --> 00:04:20.093
mmh

00:04:20.353 --> 00:04:21.768
No! Do you know?

00:04:25.052 --> 00:04:27.179
But the line was way too long, so I just...

00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:30.148
I give up and I live the place.

00:04:30.109 --> 00:04:35.104
I didn't know how good it was. Like if, I would wait if it's something I knew was good already like

00:04:35.144 --> 00:04:36.757
if I have. Yeah.

00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:46.219
Oh. Yeah.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.937
Yeah. 

00:05:14.825 --> 00:05:15.769
Oh.

00:05:17.787 --> 00:05:19.188
Yeah.

00:05:22.844 --> 00:05:23.748
Oh.

00:05:29.988 --> 00:05:33.075
I love Kyushu but like it's too hot in like

00:05:33.075 --> 00:05:35.370
Muggy, it's so muggy.

00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:41.047
I never want to go there. It's so muggy.

00:05:43.264 --> 00:05:44.169
Yeah.

00:05:51.363 --> 00:05:55.290
Oh. I know all of Kyushu is famous for their ramen.

00:05:58.945 --> 00:06:03.439
I've never, I've never been there. Wait, is it the south?

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.694
East?

00:06:05.563 --> 00:06:07.124
Southwest. Southwest.

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:16.388
Yeah, Southwest side. On the... Okay.

00:06:16.664 --> 00:06:19.758

Me too.

00:06:25.726 --> 00:06:26.749
