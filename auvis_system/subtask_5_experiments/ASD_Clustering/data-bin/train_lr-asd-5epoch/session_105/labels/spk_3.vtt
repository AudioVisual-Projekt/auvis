WEBVTT

00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:09.212
Okay.

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.377
Yeah...

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:33.089
Who's this? Mary?

00:00:36.544 --> 00:00:37.135
Yeah.

00:00:39.974 --> 00:00:42.573
Yeah, I didn't like that one.

00:01:15.581 --> 00:01:16.560
I know.... (***)

00:01:18.516 --> 00:01:21.167
I don't know with, what?

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:24.034
No, no, nothing.

00:01:34.548 --> 00:01:35.762
Bride...

00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:43.560
Ha... ha... ha...

00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:52.488
I don't think I've ever seen a romance... like that...

00:01:52.554 --> 00:01:55.068
and for international

00:01:55.068 --> 00:01:59.726
Yeah, because when I do international movies I tend to watch dramas.

00:01:59.726 --> 00:02:00.653
Yeah.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.705
Yeah...

00:02:09.092 --> 00:02:12.197
I like Jane Austen ones.

00:02:12.197 --> 00:02:16.787
Yeah, like sense and sensibility.

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:20.538
Yeah...

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:28.885
And then movies...

00:02:29.796 --> 00:02:32.496
But   (***)  okay...

00:02:32.496 --> 00:02:35.652
Kate Winslet. Have you seen it? Oh, we need

00:02:35.652 --> 00:02:40.226
That one's a good one. .. Yeah...

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:43.888
Watch...

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:52.813
Yeah...

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.257
Yeah...Well do you like them?

00:03:00.257 --> 00:03:03.007
Bridget Jones

00:03:04.474 --> 00:03:09.470
Bridjet Jones ... Wow I waatched the CD           It's a grass.

00:03:09.404 --> 00:03:13.336
It's crass romantic comedy.

00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:14.883
Ha, ha, ha...

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.831
Colin Firth, yeah.

00:03:23.492 --> 00:03:28.488
I like it a lot more than Love Actually. I'm not a big fan of Love Actually.

00:03:28.531 --> 00:03:29.983
Love Actually...

00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:32.986
Yeah...

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.322
I just think like there's all these stories going on.

00:03:39.322 --> 00:03:43.524
There's just so many stories that's going on.

00:03:46.335 --> 00:03:48.900
And I think it's just like they didn't.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.241
It didn't go into build.

00:03:52.306 --> 00:03:57.301
any of their stories and then you just sat there like you couldn't really identify.

00:03:57.192 --> 00:04:01.108
It felt like I was just watching like

00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:05.359
 A snippet of like a gossip column

00:04:06.152 --> 00:04:08.988
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:15.771
And there's a couple like I didn't really care about their relationship.

00:04:15.771 --> 00:04:15.806
you

00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:19.538
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

00:04:19.814 --> 00:04:23.577
Notting Hill...   That was cute. That was cute.

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:27.331

00:04:29.187 --> 00:04:31.853
It's like, ooh....

00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:37.625
I was like, I don't know that.

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:41.218
The roommate, honestly, but I liked him.

00:04:43.802 --> 00:04:48.019
Yeah...

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:51.716
Hmmmmmmm...

00:04:56.524 --> 00:05:01.519
Yeah Roberts was in a lot of  (***)

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:06.127
But I don't like her as a woman  like feri women

00:05:06.802 --> 00:05:11.021
It's nice. It's okay. It's okay, but...

00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:15.442
I don't .. It doesn't really rank in my top 10.

00:05:15.526 --> 00:05:16.721
Yeah...

00:05:21.651 --> 00:05:26.259
(***)   But that's not a rom-com

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.685
It's a drama. Romantic.

00:05:32.016 --> 00:05:33.582
Yeah...

00:05:34.161 --> 00:05:37.685
Ha... ha... ha... ha... ha...  

00:05:39.084 --> 00:05:41.783
Yeah...It was before Top Gun, right? Yeah.

00:05:41.783 --> 00:05:45.918
It was like Debra messing. She was still really...

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.153
Dvisining yeah.. hmmm

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:57.088
So, I don't know, but I don't.

00:05:57.088 --> 00:06:00.043
Yeah, I don't know any recent ones though.

00:06:03.848 --> 00:06:05.718
