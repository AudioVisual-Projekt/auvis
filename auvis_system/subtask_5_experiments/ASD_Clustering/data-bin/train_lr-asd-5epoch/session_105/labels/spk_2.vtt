00:01:28.682 --> 00:01:33.187

Sit and watch movies, like we'll watch Sense and Sensibility, we'll watch The Wedding Singer.

00:02:51.016 --> 00:02:55.943

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.484
Hmm...

00:04:15.728 --> 00:04:18.225

00:04:47.908 --> 00:04:51.824
It being in like a quaint area, like just a...

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:56.785
It almost makes you want to like be a part of something like that, right?

00:04:57.345 --> 00:04:58.769
Hmm...

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.929

00:05:32.745 --> 00:05:37.353
