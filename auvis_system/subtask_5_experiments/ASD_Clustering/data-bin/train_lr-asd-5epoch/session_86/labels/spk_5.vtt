WEBVTT

00:00:22.848 --> 00:00:26.905
Storm. Yeah. Yup.

00:00:28.274 --> 00:00:32.868
No, I wanted too. We want to just there's no time like still

00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:33.928
activities.

00:00:36.783 --> 00:00:40.400
Cover is always, so much like performances to do here.

00:00:41.053 --> 00:00:43.149
And so right now...

00:00:43.984 --> 00:00:49.681
I, in December last semester was I don't know which is a little crazy

00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:53.278
last semester is a little crazier with a lot of performances, 

00:00:53.693 --> 00:00:57.000
but this year, there's um

00:00:58.279 --> 00:01:01.370
I had to take a lot of videos to submit to, um...

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.189
a competition and one school.

00:01:05.057 --> 00:01:08.424
Because so I'm applying to a school one year

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.014
early.

00:01:09.723 --> 00:01:14.498
In that school, it doesn't require a high school diploma to apply. Coz

00:01:14.498 --> 00:01:18.025
Everywhere else does, so that's why, so...

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:22.102
No.

00:01:22.344 --> 00:01:25.247
I have to do my homework. Academics.

00:01:28.808 --> 00:01:33.635
uh I guess yes, I think I go to this thing called like options

00:01:33.778 --> 00:01:34.914
for years.

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:40.147
and

00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:48.500
Yeah, so... So, yeah.

00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:52.130
Yeah, it's it's not exactly is

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.383
self-paced but it's easy to like push everything

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:59.563
Like not do it, not do it. But...

00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:04.954
It's hard because as much as I want to practice, I actually need to take part of it.

00:02:04.954 --> 00:02:07.823
Three hours doing homework, which is a lot.

00:02:07.823 --> 00:02:10.827
But I just have to. And just like

00:02:10.827 --> 00:02:15.097
That is like always like fighting in my mind. Please

00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:22.927
I just think...

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.124
It takes up a lot of time in my day if I go to school.

00:02:28.124 --> 00:02:32.276
I do miss like people just like hanging out with like normal people

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.494
because yeah people who aren't like position

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:45.027
Yeah, it's pretty nice.

00:02:49.944 --> 00:02:52.552
Yeah, and I feel like...

00:02:53.487 --> 00:02:56.052
We, is like really serious

00:02:56.052 --> 00:03:00.710
You know, serious musicians who like, you know, want to pursue music.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.705
To some extent, we've thought a lot in life.

00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:09.300
Like search, research, not research, not research.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.831
just thought about about like ourselves and

00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:16.825
other people and how to like, you know, be a human.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:25.009
Um I think it's...

00:03:27.783 --> 00:03:28.638
Yeah.

00:03:31.212 --> 00:03:32.115
Right now

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.764
chamber  music, like playing by music people but

00:03:38.764 --> 00:03:42.037
thing about that is like there's a harsh reality that

00:03:42.037 --> 00:03:47.032
It's a hard life. I mean, it's not like you're not getting there's no

00:03:47.032 --> 00:03:51.538
Place to be where you'll have constant concerts.

00:03:51.538 --> 00:03:54.439
or something, as a string quartet.

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.579
Even as a soloist, that's also hard but

00:03:58.614 --> 00:04:02.574
So basically forming a team group is like also the same as trying to be a soloist

00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:06.522
And... So maybe first first

00:04:06.522 --> 00:04:09.139
Get an orchestra job? Yeah.

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.329
Go to school, but go to school for a while

00:04:12.663 --> 00:04:17.440
Just see a lot of people while you can, go to places while you can.

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:19.093
While you're at school.

00:04:26.146 --> 00:04:27.308
Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:28.984 --> 00:04:31.500
There's this place called the Kronberg Academy.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.424
Kronborg is like right now like the best school ever in the whole world right now

00:04:36.424 --> 00:04:37.461
and

00:04:38.568 --> 00:04:41.926
Kronberg Germany. Germany, yeah.

00:04:41.926 --> 00:04:44.558
There's also, you know, Vienna

00:04:44.558 --> 00:04:49.503
that's also like the place for classical music, and

00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:52.925
I've never been there. No.

00:04:54.238 --> 00:04:55.474
Never in Europe.

00:05:00.975 --> 00:05:02.077
No....

00:05:03.645 --> 00:05:06.376
So, that's why I went in 

00:05:08.213 --> 00:05:11.643
I know. No, no, no. Like, when you announced them, um...

00:05:11.643 --> 00:05:15.051
And my mom went out and I were supposed to go.

00:05:16.555 --> 00:05:19.777
And then we never were able to reuse the...

00:05:20.545 --> 00:05:24.050
So... it's.... yeah.

00:05:24.685 --> 00:05:28.313
And then since the pandemic I became a little busy and like just

00:05:32.214 --> 00:05:33.809
Maybe after...

00:05:35.513 --> 00:05:38.299
maybe like a senior summer, me

00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:42.272
Maybe, but also in the summer I want to go back to Philadelphia.

00:05:42.272 --> 00:05:44.820
So, I don't know, I don't know.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.810
Yeah. Yeah.

00:05:49.096 --> 00:05:49.798
Yeah.

00:05:52.565 --> 00:05:55.731
No, not really. Not really.

00:05:56.934 --> 00:05:58.914
but I think

00:05:59.381 --> 00:06:02.993
The beauty out was really good in that that was a place where like

00:06:02.993 --> 00:06:07.584
It sparked like my musical interest. I kind of had...

00:06:07.584 --> 00:06:11.820
I was really, really lucky to like have a good experience there.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.231
Like, and that made me like...

00:06:15.532 --> 00:06:18.046
Maybe I can like keep on doing this.

00:06:18.046 --> 00:06:21.645
And maybe I can like actually work hard, like I...
