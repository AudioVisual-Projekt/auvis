WEBVTT

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.627
Okay, 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.947
The never ending story. yeah

00:00:32.947 --> 00:00:36.575
Why did you like that?

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:42.094
yeah

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.808
oh

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:51.594
So you watched the movie and then read the book?

00:00:51.594 --> 00:00:55.746
and you still like them and the book was better.

00:00:57.822 --> 00:01:00.200
haahaa

00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:07.288
What grade were you in?

00:01:11.372 --> 00:01:13.295
okay

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.342
oh

00:01:21.987 --> 00:01:25.193
(***) haahaa

00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:28.059
yeah

00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:42.118
haahaa She probably read it as a child.

00:01:52.276 --> 00:01:54.100
What is that?

00:01:58.437 --> 00:02:03.297
There was a movie? okay

00:02:11.392 --> 00:02:15.958
(***) oh (***) haahaa

00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:17.016
Oh my god.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.249
haahaa

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.479
Okay, magical turtle.

00:02:29.094 --> 00:02:30.819
ohh

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.165
okay mmm

00:02:42.902 --> 00:02:45.821
I haven't heard of it yet.

00:02:47.498 --> 00:02:49.197
ohh

00:02:55.136 --> 00:02:57.701
Okay, what what is your

00:02:57.701 --> 00:03:02.359
all-time favorite book that you can read over and over again.

00:03:04.907 --> 00:03:07.404
it's

00:03:07.404 --> 00:03:11.167
Which ever, I don't know if I could be nonfiction.

00:03:11.167 --> 00:03:14.104
over and over again.

00:03:16.314 --> 00:03:19.200
oh yeah

00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:26.742
i really i

00:03:26.742 --> 00:03:30.490
The one book that I love and I go back to over and over is

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.433
The Anne of Green Gables. Anne of Green Gables.

00:03:36.024 --> 00:03:41.020
I could just read that over and over again.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.015
yeah well it's a bit a little kind of girly

00:03:46.015 --> 00:03:51.010
It's a little girly, but I think it's good.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.498
haahaa

00:03:52.343 --> 00:03:57.337
yeah Oh yeah, for my...

00:03:57.337 --> 00:04:01.404
haahaa no (***)

00:04:01.404 --> 00:04:06.399
College graduation, Kiku took me to Prince Edward Island.

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:10.685
yeah It's on the East Coast.

00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:14.516
Yeah, it was wonderful.

00:04:15.393 --> 00:04:17.706
i think

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.839
haahaa

00:04:22.787 --> 00:04:24.588
(***)

00:04:25.046 --> 00:04:28.168
But the author is a pastor's wife.

00:04:28.168 --> 00:04:31.171
yeah yeah

00:04:31.897 --> 00:04:36.825
Yeah, Lucy Mount Montgomery was a pastor's wife.

00:04:36.825 --> 00:04:40.301
yeah She was Christian too.

00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:45.212
And she was an orphan herself too. yeah

00:04:46.072 --> 00:04:51.034
yeah Her parents died when she was a child.

00:04:51.034 --> 00:04:55.101
Yeah. so i think

00:04:57.784 --> 00:05:02.188
(***)  the music is just sort of open action.

00:05:02.762 --> 00:05:05.007
And redhead too.

00:05:07.082 --> 00:05:10.120
yeah so 

00:05:19.214 --> 00:05:23.063
I think it's because the series

00:05:23.063 --> 00:05:26.438
It's a series? 

00:05:26.633 --> 00:05:29.220
haahaa

00:05:30.133 --> 00:05:34.808
And it goes from right? 

00:05:34.808 --> 00:05:37.457
Yes, she grew and then the last season...

00:05:37.457 --> 00:05:41.760
The very last book is about her daughter.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.029
And her daughter is pretty much the same age as when she was first adopted.

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:49.911
yeah Yes, and so it's

00:05:49.911 --> 00:05:52.729
coming to full circles and

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.563
you know the last book did you

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:59.799
Okay, I don't want to give away too much because I highly recommend that.

00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:02.364
The last book is, I think, the best.

00:06:02.364 --> 00:06:05.114
 yeah, the last week is the best.

00:06:05.114 --> 00:06:09.856
When you read it as an adult. Yeah.  and

00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:16.928
ahhm I was 15 when I finished reading.

00:06:16.928 --> 00:06:19.594
and that's the same age as

00:06:19.594 --> 00:06:24.082
Anne's daughter. yeah
