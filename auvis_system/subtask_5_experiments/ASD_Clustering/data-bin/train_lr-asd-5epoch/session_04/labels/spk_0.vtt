00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:25.537
I have kids who run away. Hehehe. They run and off. Yeah 

00:00:25.955 --> 00:00:30.303
It's just different. Yeah....

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:37.161
How about yourself? Did you always plan to go toward law firm and work as you are?

00:00:35.558 --> 00:00:41.861
How did you , how did you arrive where you are? Hehehe.

00:01:21.641 --> 00:01:24.592
Yeah.

00:01:50.987 --> 00:01:54.387
Uhuhm.

00:02:00.397 --> 00:02:04.053
Oh....

00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:10.197
Oh, I didn't know that either. Yeah.

00:02:09.535 --> 00:02:12.049
Go this direction.

00:02:13.888 --> 00:02:14.883
Wow.

00:02:28.496 --> 00:02:31.491
Uhuhm.

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:51.995
Hm...

00:02:55.747 --> 00:03:01.843
Wait, I must ask this question because I find it interesting, like my kids right now in college. 

00:03:01.202 --> 00:03:05.146
And they're thinking whatever they major in, that's what they're going to become.

00:03:04.227 --> 00:03:10.116
But a lot of people, they start off somewhere, but that's not where they end up.

00:03:08.512 --> 00:03:13.507
Right? So then I tell my kids, don't worry about it. Start with what you know, the best you can do.

00:03:13.507 --> 00:03:17.119
And then sometimes your child will wonder.

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:21.102
Because I think I hear that a lot of younger people, they're changing jobs every five years.

00:03:21.102 --> 00:03:25.235
Yeah, they cheated pretty often, right? Yeah.

00:03:30.028 --> 00:03:32.197
Yeah. Uhum.

00:03:32.727 --> 00:03:35.293
Uhuhm.

00:03:36.828 --> 00:03:39.917
Yes.

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:51.074
tsk, uhuhm...

00:03:55.871 --> 00:04:01.558
Ah, hahaha

00:04:07.637 --> 00:04:09.820
Uhuhm.

00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:36.038
Hm...
