00:00:14.398 --> 00:00:22.943
Yeah, Ha! hahahaha. Hahaha.

00:00:26.412 --> 00:00:29.490
Yeah. Yes, it would.

00:00:34.426 --> 00:00:39.188
I never did that hehehehehehe 

00:00:37.973 --> 00:00:44.433
Hehehe! I  got out of college and I needed a job

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:46.947
And, um,  I landed at

00:00:46.157 --> 00:00:51.650
a temporary, uh law clerk, a document clerk.

00:00:50.882 --> 00:00:55.926
for a one specific case with this law firm.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.197
and I was supposed to be, uhm, working with them for

00:01:00.197 --> 00:01:03.522
For about a year until this case concludes.

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:07.977
But the case went on for a lot longer than that. Um...

00:01:07.977 --> 00:01:10.895
But after that... Um...

00:01:10.895 --> 00:01:16.751
Since I was learning the ropes and learning other things and it was a very small boutique law firm.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.779
So, um. Which was great  um, learning experience.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.025
From you, because I got to kind of hop around and try different things.

00:01:24.025 --> 00:01:29.019
So, I landed, I was doing more paralegal work in the beginning. And.

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:34.014
And, um, and  I was taking a few classes thinking, oh, I might be a paralegal.

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:37.893
And um... And then

00:01:37.017 --> 00:01:40.045
I landed in some more administrative work.

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:43.514
And then position ethic *** *** department.

00:01:42.488 --> 00:01:46.106
They said, oh, do you want to give it a try? And

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:49.196
and um, at the time my office administrator 

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:52.864
was against me moving ehe! over because she said

00:01:52.864 --> 00:01:57.132
Oh no, you know, um,  I have a good promising career as of...

00:01:56.342 --> 00:02:02.517
As a paralegal and, you know, accountants like dead end work. hehehe! she!...

00:02:01.343 --> 00:02:06.186
So she actually just was trying to discourage people and I didn't know this until later. Hehehe!

00:02:06.228 --> 00:02:11.585
she was trying to yeah, she was tryna um, discourage the finance  you know

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:15.020
 finance manager to um, take me, to hire me.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.210
So, um, but. 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.618
Um They entually what happened was the girl that was...

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:24.588
that was, in that position was leaving the firm. And so

00:02:24.588 --> 00:02:27.103
They needed a replacement and.

00:02:27.103 --> 00:02:30.394
it was a lot easier just to promote someone from within.

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:32.975
So, um... That's how I got that position.

00:02:32.975 --> 00:02:37.971
But ever since then, that was it. I just never...

00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:42.851
Um, haha. You know and I stay with it. So.

00:02:41.868 --> 00:02:46.003
Um, right now like a at one point our firm was-

00:02:46.003 --> 00:02:50.205
going under, so we got bought out by the firm that I'm with currently.

00:02:50.205 --> 00:02:53.748
*** that's how i got

00:02:53.748 --> 00:02:56.178
just never  mute, hahaha. From there.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.062
Yeah, that's ture.

00:03:16.968 --> 00:03:18.116
Yes.

00:03:21.147 --> 00:03:26.740
Yes. That is the norm. That's the average they say, yeah.

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.189
Yes.

00:03:33.996 --> 00:03:36.796
Yes...

00:03:36.796 --> 00:03:40.812
Yeah. Because I was a literature major in college.

00:03:40.812 --> 00:03:46.023
So when people see me, they think, oh, I must have made it in the county.

00:03:44.677 --> 00:03:49.555
Definitely did not. So everything was just learned on the job.

00:03:57.942 --> 00:04:02.937
You know when I thought I could read over here? Oh, that's a great question.

00:04:02.937 --> 00:04:06.198
I I rarely read 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.965
Books like multiple times

00:04:07.965 --> 00:04:11.491
I'm not that type that will go back.

00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:15.491
to an old one just to re read it again.

00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:18.689
Like question, ah...

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.839
I mean, I did know when I was studying.

00:04:23.348 --> 00:04:27.100
I did uh... 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.425
The House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros had just come out.

00:04:30.425 --> 00:04:34.122
It was such a, I loved that book. It was, you know, just the way that.

00:04:34.122 --> 00:04:38.896
That, the imagery and just the vibrancy and the colorful.

00:04:38.896 --> 00:04:41.411
stories and stuff that were in it.

00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:44.196
really drew me to her.

00:04:44.196 --> 00:04:47.132
but you know I did like

00:04:48.398 --> 00:04:54.336
Um... I did like Hemingway. I just probably wouldn't that um...

00:04:52.413 --> 00:04:57.189
I loved his writing style. It was so straightforward and clean.

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:00.607
Um... I also did journalism.

00:04:59.838 --> 00:05:02.978
in high school, so I loved that, just that.

00:05:02.978 --> 00:05:07.213
16 like chris, Get to the point.

00:05:07.213 --> 00:05:10.334
You know, just just, um, type of.

00:05:10.334 --> 00:05:16.547
works or the style of it, you know, where so  I I appreciate it.
