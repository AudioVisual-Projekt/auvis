WEBVTT

00:00:15.917 --> 00:00:18.882
Yes. Yeah, I can. Yeah.

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:25.922
In April.

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:29.464
Uh... No.

00:00:32.437 --> 00:00:33.543
Oh, okay.

00:00:35.897 --> 00:00:40.773
Really nice, Thank you. Uh-huh.

00:00:43.422 --> 00:00:44.292
Oh...

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.025
Oh wow! Is that for like uh your trip, or your work or music?

00:00:54.897 --> 00:00:55.431
mmh

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:57.431
Oh.

00:01:03.183 --> 00:01:04.392
Yeah. That's what it says.

00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:09.947
mmm-hmm

00:01:13.237 --> 00:01:13.992
Um...

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:18.725
Just once, but like during the night, I like pass by it. Yeah.

00:01:20.577 --> 00:01:21.329
Yeah.

00:01:31.052 --> 00:01:31.704
mmm-hmm

00:01:36.972 --> 00:01:37.795
mmm-hmm

00:01:44.522 --> 00:01:46.306
Oh, Paris as well.

00:01:47.952 --> 00:01:52.538
Paris, no. Haven't been there. Is that for work or just for fun?

00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:54.263
For family.

00:02:01.184 --> 00:02:02.929
mmm-hmm. yeah, true.

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:16.110
So... Oh.

00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:19.761
Tough question. Um I must... uh

00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:22.496
I'll say top 3... um

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:27.491
Uh They're in no like, no particular order. But I would say

00:02:28.176 --> 00:02:29.419
Faroe Island.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.927
Yeah, will be one of them. It's like uh off the coast of Denmark.

00:02:35.407 --> 00:02:38.342
um and it's like this very small island.

00:02:38.342 --> 00:02:41.210
And the interesting thing about the Pharaoh Islands is that...

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.112
There's a lot more sheep there than people.

00:02:44.112 --> 00:02:47.791
Yeah, So like I think there's like 1 million sheep and

00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:51.724
Like maybe 700-800,000 people? Yeah.

00:02:51.724 --> 00:02:56.347
And uh it's it's like the food and the expenses are...

00:02:56.347 --> 00:03:01.342
quite expensive just because they're like kind of isolated from everyone else

00:03:01.342 --> 00:03:04.717
Yeah, But uh the thing about the Faroe Islands is that

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:07.322
there's like very like nice views

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.791
um The terrain kind of reminds me of Iceland.

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:14.993
um very like... The weather too, it's cloudy most of the time.

00:03:14.993 --> 00:03:19.989
um There's like very, like it's very green. like the

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.528
The the terrain looks like mossy to a certain point, and it's like brown.

00:03:24.528 --> 00:03:29.372
but it's a very nice place for photos. So that's... Yeah.

00:03:32.257 --> 00:03:36.053
Yes, that place. Yeah, that one. um

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.710
Yeah, it's a very epic place. Um probably like Japan.

00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:43.268
Yeah, obviously .Yeah. um

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.582
Oh, tough. I....

00:03:49.497 --> 00:03:51.585
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:53.597 --> 00:03:58.311
Um I've been to Nagano. Yeah. So um I went to where...

00:03:58.414 --> 00:04:02.149
the snow monkeys are,  and that that was really nice.

00:04:02.046 --> 00:04:06.243
Yeah, it was like probably the most

00:04:06.243 --> 00:04:11.153
snow that I've experienced like in my life when there was a ton of snow falling.

00:04:11.153 --> 00:04:14.681
and um I remember it was like super cold that day too.

00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:17.195
Yeah I went with me and my um

00:04:17.195 --> 00:04:21.077
Friends from LA and I was just out shooting like

00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:25.666
with my big zoom lens. I'm just taking photos of the snow monkeys.

00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:29.361
and there were like a lot of other photographers over there so

00:04:29.327 --> 00:04:33.192
Yeah, I would say, yeah, probably not that bad. I also, like, Kyoto.

00:04:33.227 --> 00:04:36.888
yeah just because um there's like

00:04:37.746 --> 00:04:41.883
there's like a lot of spots in Kyoto where there's not many people.

00:04:41.883 --> 00:04:45.748
kind of what I liked and also like this contrast between

00:04:45.748 --> 00:04:49.376
like modern architecture and like traditional architecture.

00:04:49.376 --> 00:04:51.890
I thought that was like super interesting. Yeah.

00:04:51.855 --> 00:04:55.939
And I feel like just the overall atmosphere of Kyoto is like a lot more...

00:04:55.974 --> 00:05:00.969
Chill, than let's say the current, Tokyo is where I'm at, cause it battle with Thailand.

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:02.786
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:06.032 --> 00:05:06.870
Yes.

00:05:07.753 --> 00:05:11.904
Um So I'm going to be spending a few days in Tokyo first.

00:05:11.904 --> 00:05:16.798
And then I'm going down to Osaka to like visit a few friends.

00:05:16.798 --> 00:05:21.792
And then I might go down to Fukuoka, but I'm not sure yet. Yeah.

00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:25.219
Yeah. It's um

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:27.732
Maybe I might check out like Miyajima.

00:05:28.967 --> 00:05:31.412
Yeah. With like the deer and stuff. So

00:05:31.412 --> 00:05:35.664
Might do that. I was thinking about maybe taking a short trip to like

00:05:35.664 --> 00:05:38.431
Korea like Osaka. Like I heard you

00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:41.986
But um yeah, I don't know, we'll see.

00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:45.156
Yeah.

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:50.025
Korea.

00:05:52.808 --> 00:05:56.314
Oh, old old train. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

00:05:56.554 --> 00:05:59.727
I was there for around two weeks.

00:06:00.208 --> 00:06:02.218
Yeah, um. Yeah.

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:05.347
Yeah, so like I uh

00:06:05.347 --> 00:06:07.861
was originally like

00:06:07.861 --> 00:06:12.400
I'm going to be there for a short amount of time, but I decided to extend my trip because I want to.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.084
Korea so much, yes.
