WEBVTT

00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:16.124
Okay, so now I have to look at this? Okay, here, I'll try it.

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:19.449
Alright. I know.

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:24.748
Well...

00:00:32.292 --> 00:00:36.544
Yeah. Um well I graduated from a bible college.

00:00:36.914 --> 00:00:40.307
So after college, um I came down to this 

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:42.905
mission for like one year. To see that

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:47.901
Because I wanted to do that. I wanted to be a self-supporting missionary. And I was actually able to do that.

00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:51.140
like do a master's degree in ASL or something like that.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.765
then I ended up. My husband turns out that he wasn't

00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:58.279
to church. And so

00:00:58.279 --> 00:01:03.274
We ended up actually in between. I had a college of four years, but I took a year and a half off.

00:01:03.206 --> 00:01:07.341
the bible. Travelling as a missionary. And I also

00:01:07.408 --> 00:01:11.998
After my first year of college, I went to, I went on a summer mission.

00:01:11.998 --> 00:01:15.828
And I ended up going to Japan then I taught English.

00:01:15.828 --> 00:01:19.085
for someone with a program that you would teach in a church.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.831
And it help like people in the church , who wanted to speak

00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:25.397
I went 1982

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.227
like made of speakers, right? Everybody could read English and write English, Yeah.

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:32.855
they couldn't pronounce English. The teachers couldn't pronounce English.

00:01:32.855 --> 00:01:35.876
And there wasn't the internet. So

00:01:36.045 --> 00:01:38.593
I was 18 and I just fell in love with 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.828
Japan and Japanese. And that's how that happened. That's probably why I'm here now.

00:01:43.872 --> 00:01:46.001
and all my kids even though

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:49.764
And then later after giving birth, we haven't got married um

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:52.751
After our three years we live in Japan.

00:01:52.751 --> 00:01:57.746
And we lived there for three years, so I should be better at Japanese, but I, we lived enough.

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.712
Uh we live in Ottawa, Ohio and

00:02:01.712 --> 00:02:06.183
there's a university hospital with church over there.

00:02:06.183 --> 00:02:09.593
so multiple, a lot of the people in the town uh

00:02:09.593 --> 00:02:14.485
working very hard. All my friends they work in the medical field and they all

00:02:14.351 --> 00:02:18.959
English.  And I like Ooh, Now I get to practice English so I didn't get to practice Japanese.

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.954
Yeah, so I still did learn quite a bit, but not as much. I wasn't able to be immersed.

00:02:25.907 --> 00:02:28.847
But I can, I can still, I still know a lot of Japanese.

00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:32.729
And I learned a lot, kind of way back then. And

00:02:33.504 --> 00:02:38.330
And um when my daughter, my husband, we had one child.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.844
one year old then I have my second

00:02:40.844 --> 00:02:44.455
were born there and we came back when they were like three and a half.

00:02:44.321 --> 00:02:48.810
 and one and a half. Only the oldest player members play in Japan. And

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.671
um

00:02:51.257 --> 00:02:56.252
Yeah, Our kids are all crazy about Japan and Japanese. So they have

00:02:56.252 --> 00:03:00.859
too afraid of roach. Coffin and morigana out of smack bed.

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.604
morigana. We, we eat a lot of Japanese food, and so

00:03:04.604 --> 00:03:07.844
I think it's all kind of feel comfortable.

00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:10.799
with Japan and Japanese and my other theories.

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.623
My mom's Chris, and I recently realized that she has culture and Japanese culture.

00:03:15.556 --> 00:03:20.045
And there's so much in common, like for your outfit.

00:03:20.045 --> 00:03:24.568
Think of things, and like, and sure have been 

00:03:24.568 --> 00:03:27.252
see on things and how you treat

00:03:27.252 --> 00:03:31.859
we talk about things like that

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.854
so I travelled in Japan and telling Japanese how...

00:03:36.854 --> 00:03:40.700
She wanted to take a college class, so I went with her, which was really different.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.852
and she was in Japan this last year and then she just felt like this is my country

00:03:44.852 --> 00:03:49.240
Japan like is so comfortable it makes you another

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.049
I never had culture shock. I never. I just felt like I liked what he was doing.

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.749
This fits us the way I am.

00:03:56.918 --> 00:04:00.328
So, that's kind of our plan in life. 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.398
She's right in front of us. She's the one.

00:04:06.014 --> 00:04:10.079
I got nine kids. So that's why we didn't travel for a long time

00:04:10.045 --> 00:04:14.416
We came from Japan. We lived in Canada again for a while and then we came down here.

00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:17.286
and spend on house like 20 million.

00:04:17.286 --> 00:04:19.497
Okay, then we couldn't travel.

00:04:20.104 --> 00:04:25.250
uh and also we adopted two girls from Ukraine 20 years ago.

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:26.738
It's another story.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:30.330
Russian.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.900
Um...

00:04:32.254 --> 00:04:37.163
We learned some to go there and then when we got back we got them to go to Russian school.

00:04:37.062 --> 00:04:41.788
Friday and Saturday, little one didn't want to go, especially the older ones didn't want to go.

00:04:41.788 --> 00:04:45.500
And then um I kind of uh

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.083
The older one comes, so the little one and the younger one.

00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:52.064
She went back to Ukraine. At least she took a Russian class

00:04:52.064 --> 00:04:56.925
She forgot the grammar, but her pronunciation, she had it. She still has it.

00:04:56.925 --> 00:05:01.548
Some of it, yeah, yeah, yeah. A lot of it came back. She listens to Russian music.

00:05:01.548 --> 00:05:06.392
They both lie like me, like they go to the class and not study. Yeah.

00:05:06.526 --> 00:05:07.488
Yeah.

00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:19.470
We have several kinds.

00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:27.384
Yes.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.726
If there's two or three times, well, you can have 

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.745
Oh They've got um the purple kind

00:05:37.745 --> 00:05:41.120
And they've also got one that's a green borscht.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.769
and they use a special plant that grows 

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:48.764
um that grows that way. We used to have a rental house.

00:05:48.828 --> 00:05:51.556
um likewise 

00:05:52.478 --> 00:05:56.460
and we had girls like for about 20 years and 

00:05:56.595 --> 00:05:59.632
terrible if your family's in a row, and you're all Christians.

00:05:59.632 --> 00:06:02.637
you know what's happening 

00:06:02.637 --> 00:06:07.108
But they had that, they were growing that plant too. It also work

00:06:07.108 --> 00:06:10.956
But when we were in Ukraine, we adopted a girl.

00:06:10.956 --> 00:06:14.990
That was the plant. That was the first of the green plants.

00:06:15.348 --> 00:06:16.358
Okay.
