WEBVTT

00:00:14.035 --> 00:00:14.825
Oh...

00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:20.480
I think I can kind of look at you seriously.

00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:23.232
So it's difficult now.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:33.978
What?

00:00:34.603 --> 00:00:35.890
Oh my gosh.

00:00:39.402 --> 00:00:40.011
Yeah.

00:00:40.397 --> 00:00:41.650
So, I'm like...

00:00:46.014 --> 00:00:47.835
And I guess there's so much... 

00:00:49.422 --> 00:00:54.282
turmoil and so much like also like industrially, you know.

00:00:54.645 --> 00:00:57.489
New things... New...

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.154
What more of the music that we hear now was from that time. Like

00:01:04.154 --> 00:01:09.082
Like, you know, it's Scott Joplin. And so like, sort of more, it's all like...

00:01:09.082 --> 00:01:12.826
19th, uh 20th century so, so, so.

00:01:13.064 --> 00:01:16.085
So it's all from there and it's interesting.

00:01:16.085 --> 00:01:18.328
There you can actually see how

00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:23.274
Like we can experience how that music developed into what.

00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:26.632
Just like I'm sure like, you know like Beethoven's time.

00:01:26.632 --> 00:01:31.305
They were really experiencing like Mozart's music.

00:01:31.305 --> 00:01:35.103
physical, because just now we can see how that 

00:01:35.103 --> 00:01:36.113
turn to art.

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:55.924
Hmmm. I'm , like think....

00:01:57.177 --> 00:02:00.635
The one that comes tough is here I guess.

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.778
Is...

00:02:03.234 --> 00:02:06.338
Like... like romantic music.

00:02:06.542 --> 00:02:08.465
It's actually much easier.

00:02:10.423 --> 00:02:16.095
You can relate to it a little bit more because it's so raw. The emotions are so... raw.

00:02:17.964 --> 00:02:20.481
It start like uh 18th

00:02:22.894 --> 00:02:25.880
Beethoven. Beethoven lately

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:30.908
Because he's I guess he's the one that's known as like a bridge classical

00:02:30.807 --> 00:02:34.401
romantic. Beethoven is more

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.400
Classical. Yeah. And

00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:43.328
So the romantic music it's also the harmonies are so much more like

00:02:44.175 --> 00:02:47.343
expressive and like, yeah. It's...

00:02:51.127 --> 00:02:52.380
Yeah. Of course.

00:02:55.344 --> 00:02:57.467
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:58.212 --> 00:03:02.346
and like the rise of like the proletariat and like everyone.

00:03:02.346 --> 00:03:06.565
Like, you know. They like, promoting themselves and

00:03:06.565 --> 00:03:10.631
What that wasn't, which wasn't like accepted. And so people are like.

00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:15.070
Trying to figure out new things to do, new ideas, new groups.

00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:20.098
it's like... Yeah. That affected music a lot. There's also like

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:23.507
French bar music that's like 

00:03:23.507 --> 00:03:28.250
a small subdivision of like classical music or like the

00:03:29.328 --> 00:03:30.242
Um...

00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:35.642
Bohemians. Like there's like bohemian classical music.

00:03:35.676 --> 00:03:37.209
It's kind of like a little like...

00:03:37.953 --> 00:03:41.510
There's no like true meaning, it's just kind of like true music.

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:42.550
Yeah.

00:03:53.005 --> 00:03:57.038
So, okay. The last one was Promenade.

00:03:57.038 --> 00:03:59.738
PMP, Permanent Music Program.

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:04.428
That's in New York. Well, no.

00:04:05.173 --> 00:04:07.179
It's, you know Long Island?

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:11.651
to the very tip of Long Island. It's a small little island called Shelter Island.

00:04:12.566 --> 00:04:13.523
And...

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:18.518
That was like probably the best thing. Yeah, the...

00:04:19.466 --> 00:04:23.936
Well, it is very um focused. Very um

00:04:23.936 --> 00:04:25.807
very packed schedule everyday.

00:04:26.823 --> 00:04:29.455
But it doesn't feel like it at all coz

00:04:30.267 --> 00:04:34.959
something of PMP that's really special is that the

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.040
Community I guess it's just the people there are just

00:04:39.996 --> 00:04:41.215
So like

00:04:41.184 --> 00:04:42.585
Real nice.

00:04:44.186 --> 00:04:47.087
Uh... The people at the camp is with you.

00:04:47.866 --> 00:04:51.999
There's also only like 35 students.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.567
Seven weeks. Yeah.

00:04:57.973 --> 00:05:01.533
But even if we had seven weeks to like bond

00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:06.968
By like day three, we're all... like... Because they really care about...

00:05:07.647 --> 00:05:08.494
the...

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.580
When they're obviously taking auditions and deciding who gets to go they have they really see

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.409
their...

00:05:18.088 --> 00:05:19.239
and the

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.720
Real person, like the person, not just their playing but also playing tells you a lot about the person.

00:05:25.093 --> 00:05:29.125
a lot much more than you think, like, yeah.

00:05:30.505 --> 00:05:31.521
and...

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.858
the Faculty are really good at finding those.

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:39.924
people who really are like who love music to like another level

00:05:40.365 --> 00:05:41.779
Very much deeper.

00:05:42.786 --> 00:05:43.938
They super

00:05:44.516 --> 00:05:47.147
I don't know. And like all those people are

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:49.897
in one fight for seven weeks and this is like the best thing.

00:05:52.465 --> 00:05:55.417
Never. No. Uh...

00:05:57.847 --> 00:06:02.807
18 or 19, I guess. Um as long as you're 18 on the first day of camp.

00:06:03.417 --> 00:06:05.827
You can turn 19 during the camp but

00:06:07.326 --> 00:06:08.240
Yeah.

00:06:08.814 --> 00:06:12.223
But you can apply when you're 18. Yeah.

00:06:12.697 --> 00:06:14.046
