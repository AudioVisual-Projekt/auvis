Session one.

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:51.705
Ha, ha, ha...

00:00:51.902 --> 00:00:55.142
So we need to talk about our favorite hobbies.

00:00:57.677 --> 00:01:01.914
Okay, I think a hobby that I started when I was

00:01:01.914 --> 00:01:04.496
I think seven, it's like playing violin.

00:01:04.496 --> 00:01:08.005
Yeah, so I think...

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:11.278
I went to see like an orchestra performance.

00:01:11.278 --> 00:01:15.194
I don't remember, but my mom wanted me to start an instrument.

00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:19.007
So I said I wanted to do either harp or violin.

00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:23.278
And then my mom was like, don't do harp, it's so hard to carry it around.

00:01:23.278 --> 00:01:27.024
So how did you violate him? Yeah...

00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:31.770
I'm still playing actually. Yeah.

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:32.558

I don't think I've properly listened through the Carnival of the Animals before.

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:49.145
Only the really famous ones. I don't know why I haven't. so

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:52.063
That's something to add on my bucket list.

00:03:52.018 --> 00:03:54.122
yeah....   Umm...

00:03:55.978 --> 00:03:58.527
Right now I'm playing a piece

00:03:58.527 --> 00:04:02.459
I started practicing one from Sun Sun's.

00:04:02.481 --> 00:04:07.476

00:04:11.437 --> 00:04:16.061
(***)   It's like it starts really dramatically.

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:17.446
Hmm...

00:04:18.913 --> 00:04:22.236
I don't know, I just started back to thinking so.

00:04:24.026 --> 00:04:27.045
Oh, thank you!

00:04:27.637 --> 00:04:32.109
That will be my motivation. I will have to really try hard to do that.

00:04:36.263 --> 00:04:37.870
My...

00:04:39.989 --> 00:04:43.903
(***)   spain...

00:04:43.903 --> 00:04:48.579
 It's been 13, almost 14 years.

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:52.983
Yeah, but it's like I've never aimed for professional. It's just like stayed something on the side.

00:04:52.983 --> 00:04:54.536
So there's a word, what's it called?  (***)

00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:58.096
Yeah, it just like, it feels really good.

00:04:58.096 --> 00:05:01.876
Sometimes I don't feel like practicing at all.

00:05:01.876 --> 00:05:04.880
but then if I go for like a couple days a week

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.356
after like without practicing and i play i'm like

00:05:08.356 --> 00:05:13.350
Oh my goodness, this feels so good...   ha.. ha.. yeah...

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.866
Oh my God...

00:05:15.866 --> 00:05:20.861
I think in other one.....   (***)  I actually took a break from it recently, but I also did ballet dance.

00:05:20.883 --> 00:05:25.844

So I think on and off.

00:06:13.155 --> 00:06:17.291
In total, it might be around 7 years in total.

00:06:17.291 --> 00:06:20.109
But yeah, it's been a long time.

00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:25.626
Actually, my studies. Yeah, I need to focus on
