00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.981
Okay, so let's talk about Godzilla, 

00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:57.001
So which one is

00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:01.878
We kind of talked about this before but what is your favorite Godzilla movie so far?

00:01:04.847 --> 00:01:09.658
Okay, so Godzilla minus one is which part of Godzilla?

00:01:09.658 --> 00:01:11.766
Not a minus one you like.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.309
Hmm.....

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.039
you don't like the first part when the Godzilla came out in a little island

00:01:25.908 --> 00:01:28.558
Hmmm...      because it was kind of little

00:01:28.558 --> 00:01:32.810
eating people part happens and stuff which you don't want yeah

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.911
but so what about uh do you have any

00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:41.027
favorite characters like people of the minus one

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.652
Guy with the glasses? Who's  that?

00:01:49.803 --> 00:01:52.689
Ohhh.... Okay, okay. He was kind of one of those.

00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:56.164
Do you think you wanted to be on that boat with them?

00:01:56.164 --> 00:01:59.624
If you had a chance, if stay somebody said, hey, you want to come along.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.100
Yeah... But I don't think they were really skilled to do that.

00:02:08.854 --> 00:02:12.618
You think you wanted to...

00:02:12.618 --> 00:02:17.478
How do you like the scene where the first time that Godzilla came after them

00:02:21.054 --> 00:02:22.206
Really...

00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:25.460
did you see the i think that's when they first

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.814
time so Godzilla lose some parts of their face

00:02:29.814 --> 00:02:32.327
and they start to come back right away.

00:02:32.327 --> 00:02:36.479
So that was kind of something new I never seen that before Godzilla..

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.855
Yeah...   Yeah...

00:02:41.946 --> 00:02:44.764
And it's not just that but they show

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:49.136
the way they regenerate. So that was kind of freaky too.

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:52.967
you can see all the bones and stuff on the side of the mouth

00:02:54.857 --> 00:02:57.776
Ohh.... Fresh. Yeah, yeah. Fresh, didn't they say?

00:02:57.776 --> 00:03:01.117
Some tooth, like bones, teeth or something.

00:03:01.497 --> 00:03:02.807
Okay...

00:03:04.636 --> 00:03:05.766
So...

00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:09.132
So Dawood... but what made them

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:13.605
Why did Godzilla showed up when the ball was out there?

00:03:18.392 --> 00:03:19.860
Ohhhhhhhh....

00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:23.004
Or is that a boat or the sound of the boat?

00:03:33.904 --> 00:03:37.178
And wasn't it when they were like exploring?

00:03:37.178 --> 00:03:39.693
putting the bomb in front of the Godzilla

00:03:39.715 --> 00:03:44.710
That's where the Army ship..Navy ship kind of came out too?

00:03:44.688 --> 00:03:47.236
And then...Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... Yeah...

00:03:47.236 --> 00:03:52.231
So what happened to the people who was on the boat? They all blown up with the boat?

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:52.603
you

00:03:54.053 --> 00:03:57.968
Both blown up, so everybody blown up. There's no survivors.

00:03:59.892 --> 00:04:03.773
Okay, so that was that.

00:04:03.773 --> 00:04:07.824
so so other Godzilla scene so

00:04:07.824 --> 00:04:10.980
At first they really weren't, no.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.012
They didn't know what the Godzilla was.

00:04:15.035 --> 00:04:18.106
So they're the islanders who thought...

00:04:18.083 --> 00:04:21.948
Actually, they already kind of had the name for Godzilla.

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:29.052
Do you know which part of the island?

00:04:29.052 --> 00:04:33.980
that was like is it from okinawa side or was  or not

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.022
They didn't really be specific, huh?

00:04:37.445 --> 00:04:38.687
Hmm...

00:04:43.952 --> 00:04:46.046
Oh really? Came out?

00:04:54.643 --> 00:04:56.857
Hmmmmmmmm...

00:04:58.296 --> 00:05:02.971
First one when the island 1954.

00:05:05.874 --> 00:05:09.805
Ohhhhhh.,...  So they kind of took that story to this.

00:05:09.828 --> 00:05:13.507
Ohhhhhhh...  lets we go..  how do you land that...?

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:17.973
yeah...

00:05:25.263 --> 00:05:28.807
Oh really? The original like 1950s songs?

00:05:28.807 --> 00:05:32.030
Had a title of Old Island or something?

00:05:33.932 --> 00:05:35.106
hmmmmmm.....

00:05:35.392 --> 00:05:40.387
Okay, do they use that same tune or same music to the minus one?

00:05:41.564 --> 00:05:45.901
Oh, you didn't listen to it. I see. So, but you kind of...

00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:48.398
connect the dots so it'll stick... to stick...

00:05:50.162 --> 00:05:51.562
Hmm...

00:05:52.922 --> 00:05:57.174
But they use the island or name of the island, one of the beginnings.

00:05:57.174 --> 00:06:00.617
Ohhhhhh,  okay...  no that's pretty cool.

00:06:00.617 --> 00:06:03.822
So what did you think about playing Godzilla?

00:06:03.822 --> 00:06:07.973
Destroy the whole building and everything and ....

00:06:07.973 --> 00:06:12.968
and the girl pushed the main character in between the building.

00:06:13.014 --> 00:06:17.013
Yeah, yeah, and she kind of blown out and then it kind of disappeared.

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:21.373
so...     so....

00:06:21.643 --> 00:06:25.607
What do you think about that scene? Did you think she was brave?

00:06:25.607 --> 00:06:26.925
Ohhhhh...

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:30.143
Ohhh...

00:06:31.945 --> 00:06:36.097
Ohhhh...  I see I see so that was so you don't really know the scene that i'm talking about

00:06:39.615 --> 00:06:44.610
Did you see that the girl actually was almost falling off from the train?

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.014
Did you see that part?  Ohhhh... Okay...

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.912
Oh, you did. Do you know what happened right before?
