WEBVTT

00:00:51.788 --> 00:00:54.894
Yeah Godzilla.

00:00:55.694 --> 00:00:57.070
yeah...

00:00:58.355 --> 00:00:59.505
yeah...

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.513
Ohhhhh   The Godzilla minus one is the good...   good  one.

00:01:05.248 --> 00:01:06.444
yeah...

00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:16.628
I like the part where he shoots the beam and it blows up the entire city. Well, maybe not the entire city, but most of it.

00:01:16.628 --> 00:01:17.490
They're hard.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.669
Oh, that was good too, but I didn't watch much of it.

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.711
That was not supposed to do. Okay.

00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:38.145
Yeah....   Yeah...

00:01:40.153 --> 00:01:41.958
I like the guy with the glasses.

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:48.692
Yeah, the one who was like doing all the scientific stuff.

00:01:57.068 --> 00:01:58.692
No...

00:01:59.357 --> 00:02:02.950
Well, I don't know. It's kind of fun to shoot the bomb and blow it up.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.308
Yeah...

00:02:11.524 --> 00:02:13.350
Yeah...

00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:15.905
Yeah...

00:02:16.518 --> 00:02:20.839
Ohhh...  which that..  ohh.. yeah... I  think that might actually be my favorite.

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:22.930
Yeah yeah yeah

00:02:28.703 --> 00:02:30.643
But then it came back.

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:32.882
Yeah...

00:02:35.468 --> 00:02:39.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess that's something. The regenerate. Yeah.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.379
I like regenerate.

00:02:44.903 --> 00:02:46.674
Yeah, how are you doing?

00:02:47.475 --> 00:02:48.761
Yeah...

00:02:49.206 --> 00:02:53.289
Um, I thought it was cool. Oh no, no bones.

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.821
You have to make the flesh.

00:02:59.903 --> 00:03:03.633
Maybe, I don't know, but I think you could come to the back.

00:03:05.212 --> 00:03:06.971
Yeah...

00:03:07.434 --> 00:03:09.261
Yeah...

00:03:12.853 --> 00:03:17.848
Well, I don't know because that like with the window I can think of maybe it's attracted by both

00:03:17.825 --> 00:03:22.483
Because they...  They were at the spot where I destroyed another book

00:03:22.483 --> 00:03:27.325
Well, I don't know but I think it was in the same area and he decided to chase after it because I guess

00:03:27.325 --> 00:03:32.321
I think it's like maybe like maybe attracted to the boat or like what you said or something like that

00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:32.759
Okay.

00:03:38.068 --> 00:03:39.782
Yeah...

00:03:44.803 --> 00:03:46.794
Yedah...  But then you got blown up.

00:03:49.634 --> 00:03:50.732
Oh... blown up..

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:52.615
Yedah...

00:03:55.586 --> 00:03:57.004
Everyone blown up

00:03:57.321 --> 00:03:58.517
No...

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.894
Yeah...

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.853
yeah yeah yeah usually (***)

00:04:17.145 --> 00:04:18.678
Yeah...

00:04:21.051 --> 00:04:23.734
Everybody  like a legendary creature in the deep sea.

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:36.953
i don't know but like i think that's a made-up island... made of island...

00:04:36.953 --> 00:04:41.019
wait oh did you know that that island theme island is the one where

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:43.837
the first Godzilla

00:04:43.837 --> 00:04:48.833
Very first godzilla well in the movie of the very first Godzilla

00:04:48.787 --> 00:04:51.605
That was the island called like the places

00:04:51.651 --> 00:04:55.413
in minus one there they were what's called Odo Island

00:04:55.413 --> 00:04:59.176
Same name for the first one the first one

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.837
Yeah...   1954

00:05:01.612 --> 00:05:06.607
That's when Odo Island first showed up, I think.

00:05:08.154 --> 00:05:11.647
Yeah...I like the plastic one. Yeah, they got the plastic one.

00:05:11.647 --> 00:05:14.162
Ya.. ya... ya...   wow...

00:05:14.162 --> 00:05:16.794
When I was looking through music of Godzilla

00:05:16.794 --> 00:05:20.929
I came across the soundtrack of the 1954 Godzilla.

00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:24.979
And then when I looked at it, it said something about Oro Island.

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:27.107
Yeah...

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.573
Yeah... yeah...   yeah..  yeah.. yeah... They probably processed it to put into the music.

00:05:40.627 --> 00:05:41.724
I didn't as usual...

00:05:42.583 --> 00:05:43.508
No...

00:05:45.498 --> 00:05:48.248
Yeah... I think...

00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:53.075
I think...I think that's what it is. I mean, maybe it's not the same island that Godzilla showed up, but ....(***)

00:05:55.227 --> 00:05:56.512
Yeah...

00:05:57.282 --> 00:05:59.515
Yeah...   Yeah.. yeah....   I   Yeah...

00:06:00.615 --> 00:06:01.901
Yeah...

00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:04.787
Yeah...  Godzilla...

00:06:10.811 --> 00:06:13.866
Yeah, yeah... yeah... and then she flew away.

00:06:14.687 --> 00:06:16.243
Yeah...

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:18.792
Yeah, she comes back again though.

00:06:22.778 --> 00:06:24.492
Hmm...

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.424
I actually didn't watch the whole thing. I only watched until like this.

00:06:29.424 --> 00:06:31.753
like the clouds started coming

00:06:34.672 --> 00:06:39.448
No,no...  no...  not really. But I do know what you're talking about. I did kind of see that part.

00:06:39.425 --> 00:06:40.775
Didn't like...

00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:49.708
No...but like I did see when she was in the water

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.728
Yeah...
