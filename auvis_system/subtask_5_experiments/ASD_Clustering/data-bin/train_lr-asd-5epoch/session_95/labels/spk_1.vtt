WEBVTT

00:00:22.237 --> 00:00:27.232
So, talking about Godzilla.

00:00:27.232 --> 00:00:29.747
So... (***) 

00:00:29.747 --> 00:00:33.848
Do you think that was the only way to kill Godzilla?

00:00:37.323 --> 00:00:38.764
I know...

00:00:40.918 --> 00:00:44.007
Ohhh... You see  could have...

00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:48.124
have other other monsters may come out in uh minus one

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.084
Yeah...  yeah...  So but if okay this is a good idea...

00:00:57.084 --> 00:01:01.422
if you two bring another kaiju in minus one

00:01:01.422 --> 00:01:03.767
Which kaiju do you think you will pick?

00:01:06.838 --> 00:01:08.441
Master King Ghidorah.

00:01:09.015 --> 00:01:12.576
Ohhh...  why do you think you want to do what about

00:01:12.576 --> 00:01:14.956
What about the rattle?

00:01:15.048 --> 00:01:16.266
Wow...

00:01:19.748 --> 00:01:21.188
Hmm...

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.687
Then the original will be the muffler then.

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.122
Yeah...

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:30.633
But isn't that the first enemy or first...

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:34.919
Kaiju that came out in Godzilla is Masa.

00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:42.477
Ohhhh...

00:01:42.732 --> 00:01:43.880
Spiky one?

00:01:47.304 --> 00:01:50.831
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That came out first maybe?

00:01:53.253 --> 00:01:54.627
Hmm...

00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:59.759
That's Godzilla and them fighting together, right? Fighting with each other.

00:02:02.982 --> 00:02:06.425
But if muscle comes out the muscles

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:10.559
Basically, Masuda is a good guy. Usually.

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:15.553
so they can't they will they will be protecting the human instead of fighting

00:02:15.553 --> 00:02:19.756
So... any... Yeah...

00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:24.751
That could be a possibility, but that means that the little Peanuts girls may come out too.

00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:29.087
start singing songs

00:02:29.087 --> 00:02:33.019
So.. Any other any other Kaiju?

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.777
or monster that could have came out of that minus one.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:44.917
yeah that's too sophisticated for the

00:02:46.016 --> 00:02:47.811
Ahh...

00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:52.493
don't you like i would like to see king ugidora like the one that we have

00:02:52.493 --> 00:02:55.345
in the animation King Ghidorah. ..

00:02:55.345 --> 00:02:58.096
Yeah.. Yeah.. free...  Wow.

00:02:58.096 --> 00:03:02.837
But it was super long. It extended from the sky to the ground.

00:03:02.837 --> 00:03:05.369
Yeah... Yeah... Ahhh...

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:09.621
I thought that would be cool to have that in that type of a real...

00:03:09.858 --> 00:03:14.430
real uh human you know i don't think that's even possible

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.817
Well, I guess we can do with the CG now. We can do it.

00:03:23.812 --> 00:03:27.172
Ahhh...What about...

00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:32.115
The son of Godzilla come out.

00:03:32.115 --> 00:03:35.085
me neither come out in the minus one do you think

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:42.523
Yeah...

00:03:46.914 --> 00:03:50.999
Yeah... So it's going to be very, very different. okay

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:55.217
or any other weapons that you might want to see when they're attacking

00:03:55.217 --> 00:03:57.530
the Gojira instead of  (***)

00:03:58.113 --> 00:03:59.310
Hmm...

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:03.317
Do you like the tank? Do you like a chang..

00:04:05.005 --> 00:04:07.840
See, that movie was right after World War II.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.835
Right?  then Japan were defeated and they basically had nothing.

00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:14.894
Right in so...

00:04:19.567 --> 00:04:22.066
Well they say that they can't use anything.

00:04:22.066 --> 00:04:25.710
because they basically used up all the resources.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.878
for the war, during the war so they don't have anything to spare

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.962
Yeah...I think so.

00:04:35.683 --> 00:04:37.124
Yeah...

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.907
I think them at least

00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:46.939
It wasn't powerful enough to attack anything.

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.720
but at least they can protect themselves from other invasion.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.297
from china or different countries

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:03.223
No.. Ship is strong enough to defeat any Godzilla, I mean, Godzilla.

00:05:03.157 --> 00:05:06.261
As you can see from Gojira and Kong

00:05:06.261 --> 00:05:11.256
Have you seen that scene? Yeah, they were like split into half.

00:05:11.256 --> 00:05:12.775
No problem.

00:05:13.968 --> 00:05:15.098
So...

00:05:15.842 --> 00:05:16.883
so...

00:05:17.044 --> 00:05:20.268
Godzilla was  well other one is like

00:05:21.002 --> 00:05:22.354
Yeah...

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.713
So he, who was the pilot guy? 

00:05:26.713 --> 00:05:31.657
He's the one who got into the airplane, right? And then...

00:05:31.657 --> 00:05:35.962
so what was the plan again for what was what was he had to fly

00:05:40.753 --> 00:05:42.998
It was for this distraction

00:05:43.217 --> 00:05:44.192
Ohhhh...

00:05:49.124 --> 00:05:51.823
Ohhh I see... But the airplane was used to do that.

00:05:51.921 --> 00:05:53.073
Hmm...

00:05:53.151 --> 00:05:57.403
But the airplane didn't have any machine guns or anything like that.

00:05:57.359 --> 00:05:58.962
Oh, you did?

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.443
Ohhhh...

00:06:00.498 --> 00:06:04.936
also that's kind of distraction so it's like hey i'm here i'm here kind of thing

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.787
Yeah... yeah... But because the airplane was fast too. Was it a fast airplane?

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:20.933
Okay.
