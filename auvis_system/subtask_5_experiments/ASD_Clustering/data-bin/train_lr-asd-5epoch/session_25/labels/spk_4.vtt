WEBVTT

00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:17.085
Huh sorry Okay, I forgot what we were talking about. Should we talk about something else?

00:00:17.507 --> 00:00:18.709
Let's see.

00:00:19.668 --> 00:00:24.359
My music. I don't know, I wouldn't really call it a hobby.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.290
But music has just kind of been something that I always do.

00:00:29.214 --> 00:00:32.594
that I was dead and something that my mom made me do.

00:00:32.594 --> 00:00:38.087
I think, again like, I had an inclination for it. I had aptitude for it. I was really good.

00:00:38.048 --> 00:00:40.255
But, at, it was

00:00:40.255 --> 00:00:43.866
something that I really enjoyed doing.

00:00:44.096 --> 00:00:47.225
I enjoy it now I think more.

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:50.008
I know how to appreciate it and I it's

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:55.003
You know, my livelihood now, so it doesn't matter if I like it or not and I think

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:57.518
That's why I can do it?

00:00:57.518 --> 00:01:00.238
Yeah, I don't know, uhh

00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:05.347
Like I do, correct, yeah, mhmm

00:01:05.347 --> 00:01:08.756
Yeah, I feel like I just had yeah, I mean

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:12.352
Of course there were times when I thought it wasn't.

00:01:12.352 --> 00:01:17.060
And, but I went, ah I did not I I have a lot of experience, that

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.498
Lot of like like people don't, so that

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:26.424
Maybe a little bit. It gives me a little bit more confidence I think.

00:01:26.424 --> 00:01:28.939
And then, yeah

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.361
And then after kind of going out into the professional world and seeing what's out there, like

00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:36.195
That also gave me more confidence to be like, hey, yeah, I'm good.

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:41.156
Like I could I could do it. Like I'm I'm better than most people. so that

00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:45.629
 like, you know, help me in that way. But again, like it's not a hobby.

00:01:46.127 --> 00:01:47.209
Like

00:01:49.864 --> 00:01:52.581
Like I I think I was indifferent to it.

00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:57.062
Like it was just something really like I did. Like I wanted to quit but I couldn't.

00:01:57.637 --> 00:01:59.728
Piano, It's interesting

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.947
Like foreign, Yeah, yeah, so I think

00:02:05.947 --> 00:02:10.367
Looking at the pictures, it looks like I was enjoying it. huhuhuhh

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:15.631
It looks like the pictures do, but it's only like a sliver of, you know, you know, the truth.

00:02:15.592 --> 00:02:16.560
right?

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:25.841
yeah, Until yeah, I till our high school like

00:02:25.841 --> 00:02:29.621
I think around 16 I went to Europe.

00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:34.759
And when I went there, like, I just kind of felt my heart being kind of pulled towards that

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:37.674
So that's the first time I was like, yeah, that makes sense

00:02:37.597 --> 00:02:42.363
or that makes me feel complete, or that make gives me a little bit of purpose to what I do.

00:02:42.363 --> 00:02:44.876
So that's kind of when I felt that.

00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:47.408
And it's funny it was in Europe and not here.

00:02:47.408 --> 00:02:52.352
So I feel like if I didn't go, I would probably be like, nope, it doesn't make sense to do music.

00:02:54.115 --> 00:02:55.018
Yeah

00:02:55.018 --> 00:03:00.188
And I think once like my my career or like my music

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.220
kind of, I tied it together with my faith.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.595
then that gives another like level of like

00:03:06.595 --> 00:03:09.970
purpose, I think, and I wanted to teach.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.712
So I didn't I didn't want to, like, perform. I do it well, but...

00:03:14.712 --> 00:03:17.463
It wasn't like a thing I enjoy, so...

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:22.339
Yeah, so, I don't know, I I when I have when I see people who do it

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:26.946
do as a hobby or like they're like so in love with it like

00:03:26.946 --> 00:03:30.625
It kind of amazes me. I was like, wow, huhuhahaha

00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:33.511
wow, mhmm

00:03:35.543 --> 00:03:36.501
mhmm

00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:41.424
Yeah.

00:03:43.696 --> 00:03:44.769
mhmm

00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:50.082
Yeah, no, I mean, I don't listen to music.

00:03:50.082 --> 00:03:53.035
and listen to music like you know how people like

00:03:53.035 --> 00:03:57.170
They say it relaxes them or whatever. I can't. huhu like

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.220
If I listen to it, I go into work mode, so I can't listen to music.

00:04:01.564 --> 00:04:04.864
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:04.864 --> 00:04:08.493
Yeah, so you're in the same category.

00:04:09.588 --> 00:04:11.006
huhhahah

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.983
Oh, really?

00:04:17.644 --> 00:04:19.521
Huhuhu, oh okay, so

00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:24.524
Oh, really?

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.033
mm..

00:04:31.778 --> 00:04:33.349
mm hm

00:04:39.924 --> 00:04:41.496
mmm.....

00:04:42.795 --> 00:04:43.945
mhmm

00:04:50.142 --> 00:04:51.253
mhmm..

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:54.426
I see.

00:05:06.356 --> 00:05:11.351
Yeah. Music is, I mean, playing the piano I think it's a good hobby to have.

00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:14.288
especially for as you like age, 

00:05:14.288 --> 00:05:18.928
because it's good for your brain function, it's good for like your coordination.

00:05:18.928 --> 00:05:21.442
Um, and like, yeah

00:05:21.442 --> 00:05:26.185
It because there's so many layers in playing, so it keeps your mind very active.

00:05:26.185 --> 00:05:30.099
Yeah. So in Japan they say it helps.

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.419
ward off dementia and like Alzheimer's and stuff like that.

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.301
So that's what they say. huhu, yeah, my team any

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:43.887
No, no, it's not the same way because

00:05:43.887 --> 00:05:48.358
When you play the piano, it's not just melody and it's not just harmony.

00:05:48.358 --> 00:05:53.353
So it's like you you have to train your hand and your mind to think about.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.510
like to multitask actually.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.108
You have to think about the melody and then...

00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:03.406
telling your fingers to do different things. So that's like 10 different fingers, right?

00:06:03.252 --> 00:06:08.017
And then that's just your hands. And then your arms and your body and your foot.

00:06:08.017 --> 00:06:12.642
Right you have to use your pedals, right? And then reading, and then listening.

00:06:12.642 --> 00:06:14.414
So yeah.
