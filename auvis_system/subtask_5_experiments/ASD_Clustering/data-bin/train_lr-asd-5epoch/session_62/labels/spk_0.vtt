00:00:06.927 --> 00:00:08.429

00:00:15.803 --> 00:00:17.761

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.349
So, tarako.

00:00:23.147 --> 00:00:24.449
me

00:00:27.913 --> 00:00:29.051
Oh.

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.254
Mayonnaise, yes, yes.

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:37.724
I am classically it.

00:00:37.724 --> 00:00:39.261
shock.

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:40.789
shock.

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:43.746
Salmon. Salmon.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.174
Oh, I see.

00:00:58.075 --> 00:00:59.670
Japanese. Ah.

00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:01.475
it is for...

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.189
Tuna, tuna mayonnaise, I think it's Japanese.

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:11.012
They put... um. Like um, um...

00:01:12.384 --> 00:01:17.379
Sandwich to Japanese, but if it's for the California roll

00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:18.692
America.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.960
Too, too sour?

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:32.792
too...

00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:36.206
Tuna flavor? 

00:01:45.663 --> 00:01:48.229
I was a Mayora when I was a kid. 

00:01:48.514 --> 00:01:53.509
So I put rice and then mayonnaise and then I would eat it.

00:01:59.854 --> 00:02:04.580
But like those who really loves mayonnaise... um

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.275
You know they get, they have lots of different varieties of mayonnaise.

00:02:09.355 --> 00:02:13.811
so they can just taste it kind of like a souvenir for the mayonnaise

00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:18.847
They can taste it and they can say exactly what brand and what type of mayonnaise it is.

00:02:20.746 --> 00:02:23.284
And then to our surprise, they're like...

00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:28.323
Hundreds of types of mayonnaise. Yeah.

00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:46.429
I think it's like a donut.

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.676
Oh, yeah, yeah, the melty, melty cheese.

00:03:18.758 --> 00:03:19.855
Aah.

00:03:20.718 --> 00:03:24.582
I think up to mayonnaise I can eat it but because I don't like cheese

00:03:26.676 --> 00:03:31.266
But that sounded good to you, right? Mayonnaise, yeah.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.179
Kimchi, mayonnaise and

00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:39.741
cheese pour it. Yeah...

00:03:40.838 --> 00:03:43.481
So going back to...

00:03:43.685 --> 00:03:48.091
Bananas you don't like, so what is the food that you don't, I know you don't like banana.

00:03:48.538 --> 00:03:50.200
She doesn't...

00:04:24.117 --> 00:04:26.012
How old were you?

00:04:31.103 --> 00:04:34.733
She told me that she didn't like mayonnaise. I mean, not mayonnaise, banana.

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:38.500
And on her birthday, I brought a pie.

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:42.301
Strawberry, banana pie.

00:04:44.245 --> 00:04:48.346
I forgot about it. Not intentionally.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.163
So I don't like cheese and

00:04:52.163 --> 00:04:56.687
any type of a dairy dairy dairy food like

00:04:56.769 --> 00:04:58.135
milk, butter...

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.459
Ice cream is okay as, as long as it's not milky like

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.640
there's like a special, a fresh

00:05:09.478 --> 00:05:10.776
fresh milk.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.278
Yeah. 

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:17.983
perfectly fine but if you go to like a

00:05:17.983 --> 00:05:21.123
um... a...the Buko sor...

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.569
farm, dairy farm and then they have 

00:05:25.528 --> 00:05:28.448
the fresh melt ice cream. Ah.

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.007
Not me, never.

00:05:40.832 --> 00:05:42.378
Oh.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.303
Yeah.

00:06:06.735 --> 00:06:11.730
I love raw oysters, yeah yeah so

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.235
I think I liked it since I was a little kid. My

00:06:16.235 --> 00:06:21.224
my parents were surprised that when I was like two or something I ate that raw ice

00:06:21.185 --> 00:06:22.194
oysters.

00:06:22.325 --> 00:06:23.342
Yeah.
