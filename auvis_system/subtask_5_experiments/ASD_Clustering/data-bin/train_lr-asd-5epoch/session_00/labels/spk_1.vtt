00:00:28.843 --> 00:00:29.581
Okay.

00:00:33.588 --> 00:00:35.627
Hi!

00:00:40.422 --> 00:00:48.101
Sure. Um, well, I work, I do accounting work, in the law firm. So.

00:00:47.742 --> 00:00:49.794
Yeah, it's you know.

00:00:49.104 --> 00:00:54.237
Hahahaha, it's i've been at this, um at this firm for. Man...

00:00:54.323 --> 00:00:57.238
18 years.

00:00:57.238 --> 00:01:00.527
One prior

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:04.680
It's, It's essentially my entire working career I've been at law firm.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.674
And I've been, um,  doing, um, accounting work.

00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:13.320
The thing that I do is more of the billing rates.

00:01:12.867 --> 00:01:16.762
That work is part of what we call a pricing department.

00:01:16.589 --> 00:01:22.103
Um. I used to do other facets of accounting for many, many years.

00:01:21.857 --> 00:01:27.471
Um. I've graduated for this. Hehehe.  This works. So.

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.842
It's an international law firm, so they actually do span a large

00:01:35.865 --> 00:01:40.859
Um, It's you know different Industries, so.

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.381
Um. Los Angeles office we have litigation where environmental

00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:48.993
Law It's all corporate. There's corporate...

00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:52.976
There there is labor and employment. Um.

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:57.312
And those are the main forces in our L.A. office right now.

00:01:57.312 --> 00:02:03.398
San Francisco office that does, um, a little more of the environmental.

00:02:02.308 --> 00:02:05.294
work, um, but then our

00:02:05.294 --> 00:02:09.899
firm is actually based out of Richmond, Virginia.

00:02:09.951 --> 00:02:11.369
So yes, and it's been around for...

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:15.654
Over 100 years, so  they they're one of the longest established.

00:02:15.732 --> 00:02:19.850
At least, um, at least  in that region.

00:02:18.862 --> 00:02:22.000
Everyone, um,  knows the firm. But.

00:02:22.103 --> 00:02:26.463
Out in LA,  it's it's really, you know, you've got so many law firms out there.

00:02:25.797 --> 00:02:30.041
 Hohoho It's not as well known, um, but yeah.

00:02:29.427 --> 00:02:33.289
It's it's interesting. You meet a whole slew of people.

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:38.076
It's interesting work, but uh hm.

00:02:51.987 --> 00:02:56.299
Yes, you know the interesting thing is we used to have different tiers.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.872
Based on the region where you worked, your billing rates would be...

00:03:00.105 --> 00:03:04.373
higher so of course like New York commands the highest rates.

00:03:04.373 --> 00:03:10.136
Um. LA, Washington DC,  um, you  know San Francisco.

00:03:09.318 --> 00:03:12.119
Those were like the second tier and then.

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:16.288
Or and we also have a small office in Boston, so that would be second tier.

00:03:16.288 --> 00:03:22.307
And then third chair would be our Richmond, Virginia office. We had a Miami office.

00:03:21.182 --> 00:03:24.955
and other offices that are in not,  as in here.

00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:28.814
Huge metropolitan areas, although they're large, you know.

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.845
So, but over the years and this.

00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:36.756
One of the things that changed with the pandemic, once COVID hit.

00:03:36.756 --> 00:03:42.230
It all of a sudden didn't matter as much where that attorney was working.

00:03:40.874 --> 00:03:45.105
Lots of people were moving around, different states, different...

00:03:44.772 --> 00:03:48.540
You know, um, working remotely.

00:03:47.286 --> 00:03:51.270
So, um, what started to be of more value is really,

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.855
 the practice area that you work in.

00:03:53.986 --> 00:04:00.252
Maybe litigation attorneys might command higher rates than, um, a labor and employment attorney.

00:03:58.948 --> 00:04:02.237
Um. So we started to change things out.

00:04:02.237 --> 00:04:06.676
and we moved everyone into one chair. It took, you know, a few years to do that.

00:04:06.676 --> 00:04:09.190
Yeah, because our chair.

00:04:09.293 --> 00:04:14.460
three fronts we're not gonna you know automatically say hey we're just gonna jump

00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:18.201
you know, raise our rates 25%, 30% just to get.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:23.094
try to compete with tier one, you know, so, um,  it took some time to do it and we're still like

00:04:22.455 --> 00:04:26.065
um, fashioning it out.

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:29.513
That's really the way that the firms are going.

00:04:29.052 --> 00:04:34.047
And, um, so in a way, it's it's interesting by practice.

00:04:34.047 --> 00:04:37.693
It was different and there's different.

00:04:40.426 --> 00:04:44.155
We have a lot of clients

00:04:44.155 --> 00:04:48.829
in a lot of different offices.

00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:53.672
There are certain hubs. We have a, um,  North Carolina.

00:04:53.672 --> 00:04:57.992
Um. Office. Charlotte is doing some financial hub out there.

00:04:57.992 --> 00:05:02.566
So the banks, right, there they have Bank of America, there's you know...

00:05:02.566 --> 00:05:07.560
Um, was *** , one on ***  california

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.139
They do have hubs and they've got, um.

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.930
We have a big data privacy, you know  that's a huge thing.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.925
corporate protection with the data, so that's...

00:05:20.925 --> 00:05:23.458
Another center.

00:05:23.458 --> 00:05:26.816
You know, so it's a national thing and we do have...

00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:30.696
Yeah, I'm not exactly sure if it's concentrated anywhere.    

00:05:30.696 --> 00:05:32.148
To be honest.
