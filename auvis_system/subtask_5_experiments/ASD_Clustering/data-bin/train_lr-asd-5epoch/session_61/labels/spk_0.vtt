00:00:13.183 --> 00:00:18.179
So, you you were telling us that you cook. What do you cook?

00:00:19.573 --> 00:00:22.550
Oh, oh, oh, oh

00:00:27.088 --> 00:00:28.256
Yeah.

00:00:32.216 --> 00:00:34.585
And then you can do... um...

00:00:35.813 --> 00:00:37.431
Nikujaga?

00:00:42.456 --> 00:00:49.085
Yeah. That's good. That's good. Yeah. Do you use cooking books?

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:55.239
No, Yeah, yeah.

00:00:56.913 --> 00:01:00.394
That's good. That's good. Yacha is a great cook.

00:01:00.473 --> 00:01:02.211
She's a great cook.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.449
I mean, she stopped us. She's great cooking.

00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:33.541
Well, that means you can use it again.

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:36.615
It'll, it'll come back. The pig.

00:01:37.336 --> 00:01:38.252
Yeah. 

00:01:43.684 --> 00:01:47.312
So you cook like two or three times a day, I mean a week.

00:01:47.312 --> 00:01:51.721
And then you eat off from that for the rest of the time. Side dish?

00:02:01.235 --> 00:02:06.240
So, Mao cooks a lot. I think he cooks two-thirds of the time.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.743
I cook only one third. And

00:02:08.743 --> 00:02:12.575
he cooks for a lot of people, but it's just us.

00:02:12.575 --> 00:02:16.101
So that was the leftover. He doesn't want to eat that.

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:21.080
leftovers or he doesn't want to eat the same thing. So, guess who eat them?

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:26.045
Me! And then I eat it the next day, and next day.

00:02:26.085 --> 00:02:29.243
dinner the next day for lunch.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:32.415
Yeah, yeah. So I don't need to cook.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.313
Yeah. So so. Yeah, yeah.

00:02:40.974 --> 00:02:43.522
For like, how many times?

00:02:43.522 --> 00:02:47.455
You have your brother so he eats it all, right?

00:03:10.531 --> 00:03:12.885
Wow! That's tough.

00:03:17.684 --> 00:03:19.101
Wow.

00:03:38.043 --> 00:03:40.878
Wow, that's a tough question. What about you?

00:03:48.425 --> 00:03:51.715
Oh, yeah. Wow!

00:03:59.148 --> 00:04:02.814
I think. I think it will be...

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.848
Rest of my life. Maybe three times it's okay.

00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:10.821
Rest of my life.

00:04:10.941 --> 00:04:15.608
That's really hard. Aaaahhm. Like.

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.845
I guess like... um...

00:04:19.845 --> 00:04:23.069
Ojira! Like a...

00:04:24.502 --> 00:04:27.793
Like soup rice, Luca-san. How would you say it?

00:04:28.272 --> 00:04:32.629
You know porridge, porridge. Yeah.

00:04:36.136 --> 00:04:37.573
Yeah.

00:04:40.432 --> 00:04:43.403
I mean, I don't think I want to eat sashimi.

00:04:44.996 --> 00:04:46.406
Sashimi pork.

00:04:46.406 --> 00:04:51.401
Even though I like it, it's good because it's special, right?

00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:52.667
Yeah.

00:04:52.818 --> 00:04:53.695
So...

00:04:54.862 --> 00:04:55.698
Yeah. 

00:04:55.807 --> 00:04:59.331
I mean, you don't wanna eat leftover pizza.

00:05:10.876 --> 00:05:13.372
And that's really hard. Yeah.

00:05:13.372 --> 00:05:17.018
Oh, What, what about like it's in the general?

00:05:17.735 --> 00:05:19.357
category.

00:05:31.402 --> 00:05:33.036
Oh.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.646
Smarty. Yeah. But then, Please give me miso soup.

00:05:49.452 --> 00:05:50.528
Oh.

00:05:54.533 --> 00:05:57.830
Oh, That's good. That's good.

00:05:58.547 --> 00:06:01.195
Harako not Mentaiko?

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.514
Aaahh.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.462
