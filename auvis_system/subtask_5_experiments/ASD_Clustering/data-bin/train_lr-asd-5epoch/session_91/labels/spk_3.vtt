WEBVTT

00:00:27.112 --> 00:00:30.339
You're going, you are going to that hot pot restaurant right? Yeah...

00:01:03.423 --> 00:01:04.367
mmh

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:10.143
They eat a lot of pork, right? Isn't that their favorite? Isn't that sort of the number one?

00:01:10.143 --> 00:01:12.877
meat in China is pork.

00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:14.326
And duck.

00:01:15.745 --> 00:01:19.575
That's why you get bird flu coming from China, because they got ducks and...

00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:24.560
When you have ducks and pigs in water together, it actually creates new kinds of flu.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.739
Yeah. Yeah. You didn't hear that?

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:32.807
Yeah, I've watched a documentary about that like about 23 years ago, how like

00:01:32.807 --> 00:01:37.462
germs flew them like they get together then create and come through their fly.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.551
Every year they um... take swabs from

00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:45.057
from a migrating birds, and they can predict what the flu is gonna

00:01:45.057 --> 00:01:47.323
from taking samples from the bird.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.483
Yeah. Truly. That's why all the flu viruses 

00:01:52.483 --> 00:01:56.060
come from China because they develop when you have pigs.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.176
water and birds. And keep multiplying

00:02:00.176 --> 00:02:05.409
But, but it's the birds, the pigs, and the water that create the new virus together.

00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:09.593
Isn't that strange? Yeah. Look it up on Google.

00:02:27.902 --> 00:02:30.230
You'll have to pay for that yourself.

00:03:27.556 --> 00:03:29.063
Like street vendors?

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:42.525
But you know in LA the street vendors they have to have licenses.

00:03:42.525 --> 00:03:46.556
And they have to get their carts checked and all this kind of stuff and their food trucks.

00:03:46.556 --> 00:03:49.663
Every, every so often they get inspected.

00:03:50.331 --> 00:03:52.580
So, just like restaurants.

00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:34.190
Pretending like they were new.

00:04:51.527 --> 00:04:56.436
Yeah. And you can't use ice either. Because the ice can also be um...

00:04:56.436 --> 00:04:59.407
Yeah. coz because it's not been boiled.

00:04:59.643 --> 00:05:04.615
Whatever makes you sick is still in the ice, so when it melts into your drink, even if you got like...

00:05:05.048 --> 00:05:08.215
like a drink out of a soda pop can or whatever

00:05:08.215 --> 00:05:11.777
that would be okay but the ice will contaminate your drink and

00:05:11.777 --> 00:05:16.772
Mexico contain... Yeah. That's why they call with magic mineral

00:05:16.772 --> 00:05:18.104
vendor something?

00:05:18.745 --> 00:05:22.389
In Mexico it's, yeah, if you're not into the water.

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.782
And whatever kind you eat in there, It's in the ice.

00:05:27.464 --> 00:05:30.788
So if you're in an unfamiliar place, you should always ask for no ice.

00:05:30.827 --> 00:05:32.784
no ice and no drink.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:36.875
I've been around.

00:05:38.253 --> 00:05:41.408
I haven't got sick because I know all that stuff.

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:50.504
that could get in your mouth?

00:05:58.384 --> 00:06:00.774
Bottle of water to brush your teeth right?

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:15.155
Yeah. 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:17.880
Oh.
