00:00:16.735 --> 00:00:18.687
Is that your song?

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.258
Ooh.

00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:44.921
Sound saucy.

00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:38.005
I have a question. So like if you guys could have your own radio station play on the radio.

00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:42.342
like what genre or genres of music would you

00:01:42.342 --> 00:01:45.059
recommend the DJ's mix up.

00:02:02.386 --> 00:02:03.214
like...

00:02:19.045 --> 00:02:22.842
Yeah. I have his.. I have one of his albums on my playtunes.

00:02:27.387 --> 00:02:29.041
They don't know about him.

00:02:49.538 --> 00:02:52.992
I really like Keith Green's lyrics because he's like

00:02:52.874 --> 00:02:56.480
kind of out there in your face like he's unapologetic.

00:02:56.677 --> 00:02:59.169
uh total like

00:02:59.562 --> 00:03:02.904
you know he'd probably get cancelled in a heartbeat because of how

00:03:02.904 --> 00:03:06.363
You know, but he has some really solid songs.

00:03:06.363 --> 00:03:11.104
Um... But when you're saying gospel, I was thinking like... Franklin.

00:03:11.104 --> 00:03:16.100
You know, all of like, like, like black gospel music, you know?

00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:18.888
Gosh, there's so many.

00:03:18.888 --> 00:03:22.641
Who who's the one who seems to sing bread a lot?

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.852
Every time I hear that song, me and my sister would cry because it goes like...

00:03:29.813 --> 00:03:35.399
all the names that they call them but like if the end is like Jesus Jesus that's when we cry.

00:03:35.202 --> 00:03:36.850
It's good. So good.

00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:39.342
Yeah.

00:03:48.618 --> 00:03:49.647
Yeah.

00:04:06.043 --> 00:04:06.791
mmh

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:08.766
Okay.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.632
Okay.

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:16.048
Venues.

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:25.810
Oh, wow.

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:37.978
mmh

00:05:00.185 --> 00:05:04.735
I wonder about his concerts, like at the end he gives like an altar call or something.

00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:05.939
because

00:05:06.733 --> 00:05:11.728
or or some kind of information out there because you have a captive audience.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:15.507
Like you can totally, even people who...

00:05:15.507 --> 00:05:18.832
you know maybe 90% of the people be like

00:05:18.832 --> 00:05:22.375
You know, we're here for the music, but that 10%

00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:25.125
can get to like actually even be curious like

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:30.120
Okay, I want to research this more. I want to look into this and... but...

00:05:47.345 --> 00:05:51.113
He's packing out the biggest venue, that's for him.

00:05:51.113 --> 00:05:52.272
That's pretty cool.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.577
to draw?

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.128
mmh

00:06:14.485 --> 00:06:15.549
Oh.
