00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:38.138
Yeah, I was gonna ask that too, yeah.

00:01:06.352 --> 00:01:09.205
Whoa, that's a big family.

00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:52.135
Yeah, did it feel like having two families?

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:25.460
Yeah. Great.

00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:42.016
Honestly, for me, I mean more than the like...

00:04:42.016 --> 00:04:45.997
You know, my brother was my half brother, so we have the same mom, but different dads.

00:04:45.997 --> 00:04:49.845
 But yeah we lived together and I just grew up with him.

00:04:49.845 --> 00:04:53.879
like just like a regular brother so more than the like

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:56.950
but really soon I feel like it was more just our age gap

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.304
but like oh, we aren't that close cuz he was eight years older. Oh

00:05:02.266 --> 00:05:07.261
yeah yeah so like i was still in elementary school when he was in high school that kind of thing

00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:10.484
So because of that I was always like the annoying little sister.

00:05:10.484 --> 00:05:14.347
And he didn't want to hang out with me because I'm always like in his stuff.

00:05:14.347 --> 00:05:19.343
he's like yeah i remember him being like yeah you need to leave my room like you're bothering me

00:05:19.343 --> 00:05:24.338
like the so that's was kind of there obviously like we would have times like road trips or whatever

00:05:24.338 --> 00:05:28.220
where we'd actually spend time and have fun, but it was worth it.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.881
Yeah, but in terms of like how I see him, I feel like I see him as like

00:05:31.881 --> 00:05:36.268
a regular brother, I guess. Yeah, because that's kind of how we grew up. Yeah.

00:05:41.061 --> 00:05:43.559
No, so yeah, actually

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:48.182
with him his relationship with his dad like his dad left the picture when he was

00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:51.304
super young like maybe two or three years old and then

00:05:51.304 --> 00:05:56.030
He had no relationship with them up until like five years ago.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.674
Yeah, and he his dad had moved back to Japan

00:05:59.674 --> 00:06:02.391
Yeah, so he met him

00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:06.980
I think his aunt, my brother's aunt, had reached out to my mom.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.677
and kind of reconnected in that way.

00:06:10.677 --> 00:06:14.609
to see if my brother would want to meet his dad and that sort of thing so

00:06:15.047 --> 00:06:17.140
Recently, he's reconnected with them.

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:29.458
I think so, but honestly it's kind of hard to say. I know in the beginning...
