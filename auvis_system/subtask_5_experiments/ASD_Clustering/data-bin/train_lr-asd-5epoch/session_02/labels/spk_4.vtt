WEBVTT

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.483
Wait wait wait oh no  no sound

00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:22.853
Ahw a lot, because it like it goes through all of like Amsterdam

00:00:22.853 --> 00:00:27.848
Germany, yes, and then there's one.

00:00:27.774 --> 00:00:31.290
Its kind of seperated like France is on its own

00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:33.858
And then the one in the Rhine...

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.688
It would go from like you could go from Amsterdam through Germany.

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:44.031
into Austria, yeah, yeah, and then like, it goes like Budapest and 

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:48.253
other areas yeah I would really like to do

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:49.874
Am the

00:00:50.424 --> 00:00:54.154
Europe like river cruise and I heard it's really nice

00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:56.972
where the ship isn't like made to be

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.336
Huge like the ones that goes in the ocean, it's smaller

00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:03.710
So almost every room has...

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.225
A view and a balcony.

00:01:06.225 --> 00:01:09.499
yeah like if you want it's the size of a

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:13.595
to the balcony like...

00:01:13.563 --> 00:01:17.056
I don't know. I think it's like the...

00:01:16.992 --> 00:01:21.852
advertisement that I get it's like affordable like it's not

00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:25.075
horrendous like

00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:32.576
No, I think the flight may be different.

00:01:32.562 --> 00:01:35.628
Yeah, just cruise itself, yeah.

00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:40.467
It's usually seven days ish.

00:01:41.206 --> 00:01:44.547
7 to 14, yeah, yeah

00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:50.682
yeah, yeah

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.061
Yeah... yeah

00:01:57.036 --> 00:02:02.031
yeah... yeah....yeah

00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:07.026
So I would like to...but...

00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:07.060
you

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:09.981
Hey, its a like..

00:02:22.462 --> 00:02:23.819
yeah

00:02:26.904 --> 00:02:29.065
That was...

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:32.929
Yeah!

00:02:34.158 --> 00:02:39.308
uh...I don't know why he just freaked out and

00:02:39.308 --> 00:02:44.100
I'm okay with kids freaking out, you know, it happens, you know, some things.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.113
Boot camp.

00:02:45.636 --> 00:02:49.922
but when he wouldn't make his decision.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.428
Yeah...yeah...

00:02:54.428 --> 00:02:55.912
Yeah.

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:02.933
Yeah...yeah...yeah.

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:07.184
So I was really disappointed because I wanted to go.

00:03:07.184 --> 00:03:09.700
Kayaking is so bad.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.293
And I wanted...I signed up because like in Japan...

00:03:13.682 --> 00:03:15.656
I had the opportunity.

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:20.178
to do canoeing, and so I would take kids out.

00:03:20.178 --> 00:03:23.082
to the canoeing...to the lake and I just

00:03:23.082 --> 00:03:26.388
it was so peaceful and serene and so I was so like

00:03:26.388 --> 00:03:30.472
okay i'm gonna kayak and i'm gonna experience the serene and it's like

00:03:35.011 --> 00:03:36.125
uh...

00:03:36.885 --> 00:03:41.678
I don't think so. I think he's stubborn in that way, but you know what

00:03:41.678 --> 00:03:44.191
What have been better is...

00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:49.186
the guy asked him the the attendant asked him to get on the kayak

00:03:49.186 --> 00:03:51.954
right when a big wave was coming in.

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:58.586
And then as he was trying to get in, it flipped the boat.

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:02.636
And that spooked him and then it was over at that point.

00:04:02.636 --> 00:04:07.581
He could. He takes swimming lessons.

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:12.087
I have no idea. I have no idea.

00:04:16.035 --> 00:04:20.541
yeah...he had a life less. But I think

00:04:20.541 --> 00:04:24.912
At this point, he was too afraid, so I wasn't gonna fight that.

00:04:24.912 --> 00:04:28.184
But I was like, hmm.

00:04:28.422 --> 00:04:31.948
Yeah, I would like to go.

00:04:32.504 --> 00:04:34.949
Yeah, I would like to go like...

00:04:34.985 --> 00:04:39.475
kayaking or something outdoors

00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:43.355
I know...But there's also a lot of places I would like to travel.

00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:44.958
Umm...Oh.

00:04:46.038 --> 00:04:50.949
More than Japan though, I really want to go see the Northern Lights with him.

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.713
I would... I don't know.

00:04:54.713 --> 00:04:57.227
Where would you go? Canada?

00:04:57.227 --> 00:04:59.778
or Alaska.

00:05:04.196 --> 00:05:08.771
Yeah, the higher north you go is better. So Fairbanks

00:05:08.735 --> 00:05:12.785
Alaska is ...oh okay in that sense.
