00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:16.498
Okay. So we were talking about, do you like camping?

00:00:16.498 --> 00:00:22.675
I did like, uhm, two years ago.

00:00:21.492 --> 00:00:25.014
I went to, my friends started taking me.

00:00:24.648 --> 00:00:29.022
Well, I went glamping first. I think that was a transition.

00:00:28.378 --> 00:00:30.808
into hardcore camping.

00:00:32.568 --> 00:00:36.814
Oh wait, glamping is in the...

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.916
RV and you have your water, electricity.

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:45.903
Transition in haha. And like, glabbing.

00:00:45.624 --> 00:00:50.009
Yeah, and then, but starting.

00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:53.588
 Um. That was 2019 right before the pandemic.

00:00:53.588 --> 00:00:58.664
And then after the pandemic, I started doing regular camping, you know.

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:01.353
to pitch a tent.

00:01:02.213 --> 00:01:05.874
Yes, no RV whatsoever.

00:01:05.874 --> 00:01:08.469
And then it was all... Um.

00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:12.203
Like no electricity.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.566
No running water.

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:19.774
that you have to go to a different facility to take a shower type stuff.

00:01:18.936 --> 00:01:24.047
Yeah, and then the last camping I went was Death Valley.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.360
And we didn't even have water.

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:30.984
like a facility that we can go to so it was no shower, hahaha.

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:34.590
Like, but i love that...

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:36.890
Yeah, there was like what there was like a little scene

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.467
that they provided so you could at least wash your face.

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:44.856
Um. like brush your teeth and stuff like that.

00:01:48.636 --> 00:01:51.650
No, because it's deat- Death Valley.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.402
So yeah, I don't trust the water.

00:01:54.306 --> 00:01:58.710
Huhahihi *** **** 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.859
Hahaha, so. But i

00:02:01.493 --> 00:02:05.678
want to go camping with everybody.

00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:08.750
Where would you recommend?

00:02:15.332 --> 00:02:18.436
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:18.436 --> 00:02:22.309
Also nearby like a city

00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:28.962
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:29.692 --> 00:02:34.267
Yeah, do,  what kind of?  do you like beach?

00:02:33.794 --> 00:02:38.235
or mountains.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.691
Yeah.

00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:46.640
Yeah. 

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:52.252
Do you want desert area or non-desert area? like.

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.084
Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:56.084 --> 00:03:01.079
I, I would love to go camping with everybody.

00:03:01.445 --> 00:03:03.389
Yah.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.947
I did. Some of them, yes.

00:03:11.947 --> 00:03:17.336
And I was wondering if we ever wanted to do a huge family.

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:19.136
to get together again, I feel like

00:03:19.136 --> 00:03:24.974
America's side relatives are a lot more...

00:03:23.168 --> 00:03:27.063
Travel Savvy.

00:03:26.376 --> 00:03:29.931
Right, so I think if

00:03:29.244 --> 00:03:34.318
It's easier for us to go and join a cruise over there.

00:03:33.308 --> 00:03:36.720
than having them come here.

00:03:36.247 --> 00:03:41.365
Because when the Japan side come it's like 100% we have to like

00:03:41.108 --> 00:03:47.372
hospitality has drive and none of them can drive

00:03:53.634 --> 00:03:56.492
Hahahaha.

00:03:56.902 --> 00:03:58.492
Ha ha ha

00:04:02.758 --> 00:04:06.965
Oh, oh, so the cruise part is a secret. 

00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:09.559
And then we just say we'll get together after the cruise.

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:14.133
Oh, that, that's, that's good. Yeah, yeah. I know what you mean.

00:04:13.015 --> 00:04:15.803
So which kind? Um.

00:04:15.803 --> 00:04:18.654
Have you looked into the cruises in Japan?

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:29.430
Uhum, Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:35.815 --> 00:04:39.059
Okay ***

00:04:39.562 --> 00:04:42.582
That's amazing. 

00:04:44.928 --> 00:04:48.320
what, i like.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.119
I'm not really too keen on cruise, but...

00:04:51.087 --> 00:04:55.974
The other cruise that I do feel like, oh, I want to try.

00:04:54.985 --> 00:04:56.740
would be a river cruise.

00:04:59.593 --> 00:05:03.913
Yes, stays on the river so it stops by all major cities.

00:05:03.204 --> 00:05:05.685
Europe has a lot of it.

00:05:11.202 --> 00:05:14.594
No, no, no, no, no, no.
