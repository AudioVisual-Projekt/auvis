WEBVTT

00:00:15.868 --> 00:00:19.276
Yeah, Yeah for sure. You like it. Yeah, you like it.

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:34.220
What do you consider glamping? Like what's glamping to you?

00:00:37.038 --> 00:00:38.151
Ah haan

00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:42.118
Ah haan. Oh oh yeah.

00:00:42.118 --> 00:00:46.541
Okay, yeah yeah yeah, that definitely qualifies as glamping.

00:00:57.895 --> 00:01:02.368
And what did you do? Oh, you like actually stayed in the tent?

00:01:02.368 --> 00:01:07.109
So no RV whatsoever? Ok ok

00:01:11.565 --> 00:01:15.074
Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:20.205
Okay. Yeah. 

00:01:30.396 --> 00:01:34.009
okay what was there any like body of water though like

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.387
ok

00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:47.474
It's usually like when I go like camping camping like the river or the lake

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:50.241
Is this your shower?

00:01:51.407 --> 00:01:54.411
Oh, okay. Yeah, there's... Oh.

00:01:54.435 --> 00:01:58.215
Well, it's like a leap of faith. He he he 

00:02:04.146 --> 00:02:08.146
Yeah, that'd be fun. That'd be fun

00:02:08.146 --> 00:02:12.636
I say for the first time around, somewhere...

00:02:12.636 --> 00:02:15.149
With at least like the basic stuff?

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:18.338
right and something accessible so it's easy to get to.

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:24.752
Like, I wouldn't want to go any further out than more than two hours.

00:02:24.776 --> 00:02:27.290
You know what I mean?

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:30.861
Yeah, so it's a little easy for everybody to get to it.

00:02:34.117 --> 00:02:39.111
I like...I like all of them, honestly. They each have their pros and cons.

00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:43.583
I mean if it's like away from the city lights, I think that's the best

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:48.494
yeah yeah because then you can actually see like the milky way

00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:55.194
Honestly, as long as it's camping, it's fun either way. Yeah.

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.831
yeah yeah

00:03:00.122 --> 00:03:03.951
That sounds fun, yeah. Okay, going back to the cruise thing though...

00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:07.630
Have you seen the cruises that are available in Japan?

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.178
They look amazing

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:24.658
Easy going?

00:03:24.658 --> 00:03:28.083
Oh Yeah

00:03:43.236 --> 00:03:45.802
Right.

00:03:45.802 --> 00:03:50.796
Honestly, like, with me, if we google it like a cruising in Japan together...

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:53.328
I say we go incognito in the beginning.

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.206
maybe invite like maki and fuki may be you know

00:03:58.206 --> 00:04:02.711
And then just do that real quick and then say, oh, we made it to Japan, you know?

00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:04.254
Hee.....

00:04:06.018 --> 00:04:09.578
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:09.578 --> 00:04:14.320
You know! I think that'll, yeah.

00:04:18.387 --> 00:04:20.902
Okay, I'm mean just like

00:04:20.902 --> 00:04:25.137
Okay, I wasn't being realistic budget-wise when I was looking at it, so I was looking at the really nice ones

00:04:25.137 --> 00:04:29.779
where they only have 30, 40 people. Yes, and those are like...

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:33.221
Really nice and stupid expensive, you know, so

00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:36.832
I didn't looked at like more modest ones. Yeah.

00:04:36.832 --> 00:04:41.270
But I have a feeling since this is Japan, right? Even the modest ones are going to be really nice.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.781
Yeah. Yeah

00:04:44.781 --> 00:04:46.704
So I don't know. That's what I was looking at.

00:04:57.638 --> 00:05:00.171
Like it just stays on the river me

00:05:05.991 --> 00:05:09.299
Oh Okay, now you're going slower, yeah. See, when you said river cruises...

00:05:09.299 --> 00:05:14.294
I was thinking like, the Mississippi. I was like, I don't want to hang out in the South.

00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:15.976
Ha...
