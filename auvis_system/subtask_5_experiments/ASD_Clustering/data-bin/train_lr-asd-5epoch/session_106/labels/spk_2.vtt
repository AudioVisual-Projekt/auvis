00:00:13.118 --> 00:00:14.962
Okay..

00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:19.468

I love okay I love that one.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.494
I know because I was like...

00:00:32.494 --> 00:00:37.439
Because I was a bridesmaid so many times, I still have all my dresses.

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:40.359
Because I didn't want to just  (***) 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:45.134
throw it away. Some people are going to regret that they made me wear some of the dresses.

00:00:45.134 --> 00:00:48.896
If I ever get married, they're gonna wear that.

00:00:54.938 --> 00:00:57.344
Ohhhhhhhh....

00:01:03.085 --> 00:01:06.414

00:01:15.897 --> 00:01:18.024

00:01:24.632 --> 00:01:28.125
Oh, okay then. I can't.

00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:31.388
Well, I don't remember.

00:01:31.388 --> 00:01:36.384
And it was cute while watching but I can't tell you much about it.

00:01:38.995 --> 00:01:40.955

00:02:06.555 --> 00:02:10.016
Ohhh... I like  (***)

00:02:10.893 --> 00:02:15.887
It's the one where ahh the guy she likes.

00:02:15.832 --> 00:02:18.802
Ha..  falls on the train tracks and she saves him.

00:02:18.857 --> 00:02:21.203
And yeah.

00:02:24.545 --> 00:02:29.202
Yeah, well then like she accidentally says, ooh, I was gonna marry him.

00:02:29.202 --> 00:02:33.927
And then the family thinks she's engaged and then she falls in love with the actual guy.

00:02:33.927 --> 00:02:35.261
Father.

00:02:36.813 --> 00:02:41.403

He's not the heart Rob.

00:02:50.531 --> 00:02:53.113
Kind of a rom-com guy.

00:03:02.304 --> 00:03:04.513
Ha... ha... ha... ha... ha...  

00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:07.136

I loved Spaceballs, see that was my...

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:16.908
Idea of Star Wars.

00:03:16.888 --> 00:03:17.993

I hate..I..  but I love that movie.

00:04:00.884 --> 00:04:03.769
I saw that before Star Wars.

00:04:03.687 --> 00:04:06.859
And I didn't like the real star.

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.844
Ha, ha, ha...

00:04:09.955 --> 00:04:11.750

 Depth... What is that...

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.241
I don't know if it's the same phrase

00:05:02.241 --> 00:05:07.236
yeah the phrase because a lot of people who love that movie is like as you wish is what

00:05:07.236 --> 00:05:10.274
They love because of romance, like whatever. (***)

00:05:10.274 --> 00:05:14.358
