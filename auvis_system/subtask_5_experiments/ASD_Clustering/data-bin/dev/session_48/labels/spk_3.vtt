00:03:36.728 --> 00:03:40.576
(***) David (***)

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:43.680
Yeah, I think she dropped the camera already.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.541
She might withdraw. Yeah, I think she's she's

00:03:48.541 --> 00:03:52.642
Her mom is making her wait till today so I think she's dropping it though.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.637
She's like overwhelmed. yeah

00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:05.246
She dropped 14-D, like, she walked into the midterm.

00:04:05.246 --> 00:04:09.026
(***)she dropped her glitter.

00:04:09.026 --> 00:04:12.048
But like, will that affect your housing for next year?

00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:21.684

00:04:21.865 --> 00:04:24.723
oh

00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:27.555
Yes, (***)

00:04:32.162 --> 00:04:34.542
Is it called dropping or is it withdrawing? I guess it's the same thing.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.427
Ahh

00:04:37.562 --> 00:04:38.321
Yeah.

00:04:45.476 --> 00:04:49.629
Yeah, she dropped 14D like, 

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:55.821
To withdraw? I guess her mom wants her to think it through more.

00:04:55.821 --> 00:04:59.668
yeah i think

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:03.870
I think so. I think it's only like one quarter long and she has like scope and she has a lot.

00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:10.672
Like EMT? Maybe.

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:15.430
I don't think so. I don't think she can handle that.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.602
I mean, I don't know. Yeah yeah

00:05:18.602 --> 00:05:21.218
I don't think so.

00:05:21.218 --> 00:05:25.117
I think she's going through a lot. I'm not sure. but

00:05:25.117 --> 00:05:28.289
(***) why would they drop david dropped it too it was not bad

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.804
Anderson is that bad?

00:05:30.804 --> 00:05:35.629
14D. This was Anderson. No, no, Anderson. Fam is good. I heard Fam is good.

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.143

00:05:38.143 --> 00:05:42.177

00:05:42.261 --> 00:05:42.761

00:05:42.987 --> 00:05:46.783
You did 14D last quarter? Yes! Oh!

00:06:10.088 --> 00:06:12.872
 what do you mean? I'm not a memorizing person

00:06:16.078 --> 00:06:16.922
Well, that's a good thing.

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:19.437
oh

00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:22.795
Does she feel like she has to? Well, yeah. Yeah,

00:06:23.723 --> 00:06:26.862
I mean, it's not like a mind test. I think she's just like, oh, I'm not good at this.

00:06:33.496 --> 00:06:36.834
ha ummm

00:06:38.117 --> 00:06:40.902
I mean, I guess not. At that point, she's like, I'm gonna retake it.

00:06:50.605 --> 00:06:54.722
I thought it was, someone told me it's not a prereq, it's recommended.

00:06:56.713 --> 00:07:00.866
Do you need 14C? As a prereq, not a co-req?

00:07:03.008 --> 00:07:06.484
Do we stop it?
