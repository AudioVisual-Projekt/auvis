00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:15.146
Grand Idotape.

00:02:17.828 --> 00:02:20.326
I guess  yeah.

00:02:20.326 --> 00:02:24.679
It's very hard to play, so I cannot play it well.

00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:30.587

00:02:36.872 --> 00:02:38.504

00:02:59.986 --> 00:03:00.742
Yeah.

00:03:18.427 --> 00:03:21.583

00:03:21.583 --> 00:03:24.975

00:03:24.975 --> 00:03:29.817
tharaeeera and then The one Jason was playing.

00:03:29.817 --> 00:03:33.480
And then grad I didn't

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.803
Party number two, Sarah Bond, and...

00:03:37.226 --> 00:03:40.954

00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:46.298
Yeah

00:03:46.676 --> 00:03:48.819
But I have a plane.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.362
That was so bad, so like Eastman's audition?

00:03:56.362 --> 00:04:01.357
I did not know that for the live audition it's a little different than the

00:04:01.357 --> 00:04:05.188
pre-stream requirements, but basically you have to play the full box.

00:04:05.188 --> 00:04:07.279
No, wait.

00:04:07.517 --> 00:04:10.402
No, actually, never mind. Sorry. It had to be one.

00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:14.941
G No, not G, fugue.

00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:17.489
I did not know that. I did not have it ready.

00:04:17.777 --> 00:04:21.269
So basically my professor was friends with...

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.892
the professor there so they like asked for me and then he said it was fine and a lot of people like

00:04:25.892 --> 00:04:27.934
didn't have food prepared.

00:04:28.374 --> 00:04:31.428
2 by 5 (***)

00:04:31.428 --> 00:04:33.857
Yeah.

00:04:44.726 --> 00:04:46.987
yeah It is pretty fine.

00:04:52.657 --> 00:04:54.715
Six hours away from New York City.

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.896
Yeah it's basically Canada.

00:04:59.997 --> 00:05:04.335
Like right next to you.

00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:15.134
I think I want to get a doctor.

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:19.994
And also you have to write a dissertation.

00:05:19.994 --> 00:05:22.931
And that's like a hundred pages of something, right?

00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:27.537
I don't feel like doing that. Maybe an artist diploma?

00:05:27.537 --> 00:05:30.119
But at the same time, I want to stay in California.

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:34.472
But there's not too many like artist diploma degrees here.

00:05:34.472 --> 00:05:37.763
Besides like Colbert like that's hard to

00:05:37.763 --> 00:05:41.831
Like, we can't get in, though. So, like... No, no, no. I mean, that's okay.

00:05:47.282 --> 00:05:52.276
I think you see

00:05:52.276 --> 00:05:52.461

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:57.643
Last one, so I might apply to those, but...

00:05:57.643 --> 00:06:00.139
Wait, what about 

00:06:01.405 --> 00:06:06.333
How about you guys? What do you guys want to do?

00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:10.602
Orchestra! Wait, why?

00:06:18.078 --> 00:06:21.571
Really? I have a question.

00:06:21.571 --> 00:06:24.085
Do you only get to apply to like...

00:06:24.085 --> 00:06:26.701

00:06:26.701 --> 00:06:30.920
smaller orchestras that people can join too. I just don't know.
