WEBVTT

00:00:18.714 --> 00:00:19.506
oh

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.012
Yeah, maybe like in between.

00:00:24.012 --> 00:00:27.032
Yeah, I said like a shorter like brunette.

00:00:27.032 --> 00:00:30.508
Like it doesn't you know, it's like

00:00:30.508 --> 00:00:35.352
It doesn't go past his year, type 5. 

00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:38.052
I don't remember enough. Yeah.

00:00:38.052 --> 00:00:43.013
I just know he's been there.  She has a photo. I don't think

00:00:43.013 --> 00:00:45.798
Maybe we can try to stalk the media team.

00:00:45.798 --> 00:00:50.439
Because it was from the media team photo shoot.

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:54.184
Y'all are very interested in him

00:00:54.883 --> 00:00:56.259
yeah

00:00:58.437 --> 00:01:02.757
I feel like you would do the G.K.L. one day.

00:01:02.757 --> 00:01:05.542
Yeah I feel like I could see you doing it.

00:01:11.498 --> 00:01:15.110
You know You know how north

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.536
wait i forget which school it is but they do like the marriage pact

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:22.939
Certain colleges do a marriage patch where like

00:01:23.462 --> 00:01:27.343
They'll make all the, if they want to do it, all the undergraduate students fill out a form.

00:01:27.343 --> 00:01:29.858
About what they want in their life like future

00:01:29.858 --> 00:01:34.010
partner and then you get matched with someone randomly at your campus.

00:01:47.593 --> 00:01:50.935
Yeah, I forgive but like yeah

00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:55.525
Apparently they do that at some schools.

00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:02.849
Oh. (***)

00:02:04.198 --> 00:02:06.697
Or maybe it's something like that.

00:02:06.697 --> 00:02:11.691
Oh, no, it's UW. My friend did it at UW.

00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:13.447
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:15.438 --> 00:02:16.873
Um...

00:02:17.497 --> 00:02:22.322
I don't think she did it because she has a boyfriend.  Sorry.

00:02:22.322 --> 00:02:26.694
a man like I think she told me about her friends. yeah

00:02:26.694 --> 00:02:30.676
Because I feel like oh no no no no no wait. It's the other friend. I was with

00:02:30.676 --> 00:02:33.763
Not UW, it was North...

00:02:33.763 --> 00:02:38.759
the better one northwest northwest sorry it's one of the north

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:41.323
The purple one.

00:02:41.323 --> 00:02:44.412
Yeah, she was telling us that like he seemed like

00:02:44.412 --> 00:02:47.416
He wouldn't respond to her email cuz like

00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:51.146
The contact information that they give you is only the email address.

00:02:51.146 --> 00:02:53.660
well

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.148
Because they get matched about what they answered in the questionnaire.

00:02:58.148 --> 00:03:00.578
I think so, yeah.

00:03:01.456 --> 00:03:03.531
yes

00:03:06.063 --> 00:03:07.530
I think so, yeah.

00:03:09.876 --> 00:03:13.487
It's the girl that transferred out of UCLA.

00:03:16.035 --> 00:03:20.136
The girl I just told you about. The north, eastern, western bastard.

00:03:20.136 --> 00:03:25.098
yeah, She's like i Okay, she's kind of strange

00:03:25.073 --> 00:03:28.617
She's like a creative writing and journalist type major girl.

00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:31.426
Yeah, she like (***)

00:03:31.426 --> 00:03:35.560
transferring or maybe she's just really indecisive but like in high school

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.813
She started at my high school and then she started at Portola.

00:03:39.813 --> 00:03:43.981
and then went there for two years and then came to uni for her third year

00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:45.263
and then

00:03:45.534 --> 00:03:50.005
Went back to Portola as family, yeah.

00:03:52.486 --> 00:03:55.725
i Think she kept transferring it cuz like  

00:03:55.725 --> 00:03:59.118
The high schools in our district have different like

00:03:59.118 --> 00:04:03.488
requirements like oh like your second year you can only take these classes you know

00:04:03.488 --> 00:04:06.660
and I think she wanted to like schedule her classes around like

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.884
Certain like a peeling or like a (***)

00:04:09.884 --> 00:04:12.736
(***) i don't know

00:04:12.736 --> 00:04:17.089
But like she's saying how she's gonna do transfer apps again this year.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:21.326
Even though Northwestern is the number one creative writing program in the US.

00:04:21.326 --> 00:04:26.270
She's saying she's doing transfer if she wants to go back to LA

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.071
She still has like

00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:33.340
couldn't get into, so she says she's gonna keep applying until she can't apply anymore.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.121
she (***)

00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:42.115
yes that's what i'm saying she's a little strange so i think she's applying to like columbia again like

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.667
other one

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:50.739
I don't know, maybe she was like, maybe I don't like Northwestern, so I'll apply back to UCLA just in case.

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:54.569
And like since she's like a creative writing like person

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.100
the essays are just like

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.256
creative writing but like maybe a bit more pressure

00:05:00.256 --> 00:05:04.153
So it's just easy for her, I guess. 

00:05:04.153 --> 00:05:07.513
I don't know, that's why I said she's weird.

00:05:08.845 --> 00:05:13.502
I feel like that hurts you more than... yeah

00:05:15.088 --> 00:05:19.511
I think she wants to be more of like an author.

00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:24.302
she like released a book before. 

00:05:25.737 --> 00:05:27.542
oh

00:05:28.386 --> 00:05:33.381
no i mean she's just like a minor author you know

00:05:33.381 --> 00:05:33.432
you

00:05:37.432 --> 00:05:40.453
Well, she's kicking  Yeah.

00:05:40.526 --> 00:05:44.171
She said oh my god, she told me like my stairs. Yeah

00:05:44.098 --> 00:05:48.468
You know how like Jocelyn always asks for Instagrams at parties?

00:05:48.468 --> 00:05:50.999
At Northwestern it's LinkedIn.

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:54.492
It's so normal for someone to just come up to you and ask for your LinkedIn.

00:05:54.492 --> 00:05:57.158
Like that's the first start of the conversation.

00:05:57.158 --> 00:06:00.669
(***)  northwestern 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.756
Right? Isn't that crazy? I repeat...

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.689
i really bad like yeah

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:12.413
We don't even want to get to know you as a person, it's just what you do academically.
