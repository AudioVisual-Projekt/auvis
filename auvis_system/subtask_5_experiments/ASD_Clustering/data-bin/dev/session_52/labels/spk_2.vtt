WEBVTT

00:00:13.897 --> 00:00:18.638
What were we talking about? 

00:00:18.638 --> 00:00:23.634
no yeah consider i (***) most (***)

00:00:23.634 --> 00:00:26.958
genuinely consider  (***) oh

00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:31.498
and i was like yeah so actually he hasn't been showing up to orchestra

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:35.413
Uh oh. He was like, it's not just studio.

00:00:35.413 --> 00:00:38.096
And I was like, yeah, it's not just studio.

00:00:38.096 --> 00:00:42.331
And then he progresses and goes like, do you know if he's showing up?

00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:45.724
I think Nathan or something

00:00:45.724 --> 00:00:50.397
I'm pretty sure he oh she was saying stuff like

00:00:50.397 --> 00:00:53.013
about how he was not showing up.

00:00:53.013 --> 00:00:58.008
I know a couple people in the same class as him and I'm pretty sure like she doesn't go

00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:00.608
And then you would listen was like

00:01:00.608 --> 00:01:03.205
This is like a serious issue like

00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:06.311
Like he genuinely thought it was a health issue.

00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:11.205
Because he just kept saying doctors, ER, doctors.

00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:15.221
And then I was like, yeah, um, he just hasn't been coming, and then

00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:18.511
We had a three-way conversation.

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:23.338
where jaeson and him (***) like

00:01:23.338 --> 00:01:26.797
(***)

00:01:26.797 --> 00:01:30.864
Yeah, I know. Yeah,

00:01:33.058 --> 00:01:37.799
I don't know. That's a good question.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.794
i don't know how he would pass orchestra he missed like

00:01:42.794 --> 00:01:46.827
missed technically  yeah 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.076
like how would you guys I don't know how I forget but like I don't know 

00:01:52.076 --> 00:01:56.665
and like he was he was g-young student before here

00:01:56.665 --> 00:01:59.754
so like they have to like mother

00:01:59.754 --> 00:02:03.618
He was a g-young student.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.592
 something like that. yeah

00:02:07.668 --> 00:02:12.073
Yes, yes, yes. So like, he just like continuously came here.

00:02:12.073 --> 00:02:16.831
but like 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:22.080
(***)

00:02:24.695 --> 00:02:28.998
She's like, is your mom a tiger mom?

00:02:28.998 --> 00:02:33.082
no yeah (***)

00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:38.785
I feel like our grade. it's like

00:02:38.785 --> 00:02:43.021
fine except for jaeson yeah and like 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.493
Yeah, cuz like  yeah yeah 

00:02:47.493 --> 00:02:51.949
Naeson and Jaeson They'll probably never be good friends ever.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.879
Yeah  yeah.

00:03:12.924 --> 00:03:17.919
Yeah that was a good move

00:03:19.793 --> 00:03:24.788
Yeah, rgood move. 

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:28.516
Yeah

00:03:28.837 --> 00:03:33.629
Yeah, I don't know where he gets those guts, but he should not be saying that.

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.624
i feel Like , you know, 

00:03:38.624 --> 00:03:41.359
(***)

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.509
I feel like nothing is going to happen until we tell Pugosi and Wonjiyoung.

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:49.053
(***)

00:03:49.053 --> 00:03:51.906
What's another one?

00:03:51.906 --> 00:03:54.437
I thought he was gonna switch it off. like

00:03:54.437 --> 00:03:57.711
I guess there's nothing he can switch out to.

00:04:01.896 --> 00:04:06.890
data of science or date of theory i don't lknow

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.043
you

00:04:08.797 --> 00:04:12.796
but i think so too

00:04:12.796 --> 00:04:17.791
(***)  Have you encountered him?

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:21.368
Have you encountered a wild Jason?

00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:26.988
sshhh

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:35.612
And he's watching videos. Yeah. 

00:04:35.612 --> 00:04:37.113
that's why

00:04:39.156 --> 00:04:44.033
And that's why he doesn't show up to orchestra and studio. 

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:46.278
Yeah

00:04:46.377 --> 00:04:50.766
I was watching videos in the practice room and there was no ID card and it was like one of those rooms

00:04:50.766 --> 00:04:53.567
where you can like there's a wall to hide behind.

00:04:53.567 --> 00:04:56.756
you know like one of the bigger ones there so then i was like

00:04:56.756 --> 00:05:01.278
oh this is(***)I didn't see a backpack or an instrument.

00:05:01.278 --> 00:05:03.995
Open it and then the moment I went in I turned around

00:05:03.995 --> 00:05:08.805
And I saw Jason and I was like, oh, sorry. And I was like, oh, sorry?

00:05:08.805 --> 00:05:13.800
Yeah, I feel like (***) yeah

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.596
i don't want (***)

00:05:17.596 --> 00:05:21.596
bother with him so I just let him be. 

00:05:21.596 --> 00:05:25.663
Yeah I'm surprised he's been showing up to the studio

00:05:25.663 --> 00:05:28.430
Like isn't this shocking?

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:33.966
Like cuz like he used to never come ever

00:05:34.184 --> 00:05:37.290
Oh, true.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.821
We're both seeing

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:45.524
oh, wait, yeah, that makes sense.

00:05:45.524 --> 00:05:49.929
 Yeah

00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:54.874
That's true yeah

00:05:57.321 --> 00:05:59.750
That's not Jason.

00:06:01.336 --> 00:06:03.833
 I bet!

00:06:04.008 --> 00:06:06.995
Yeah, here. Everyone thought that he was...

00:06:06.821 --> 00:06:09.740
(***)

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.735
And then all of us like
