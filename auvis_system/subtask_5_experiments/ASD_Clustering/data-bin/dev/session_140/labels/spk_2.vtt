00:00:17.937 --> 00:00:21.565
Genshin impact

00:00:25.632 --> 00:00:27.151
It's very close

00:01:00.057 --> 00:01:03.230
Until no one thinks it's crazy

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.086
Hahaha

00:01:28.086 --> 00:01:32.423
What is that? Hong Kong? No.

00:01:32.423 --> 00:01:35.664
See, because I don't like it. I don't like waiting for it to load.

00:01:35.664 --> 00:01:39.208
on my phone so i get really bored and then i delete it

00:01:42.244 --> 00:01:45.214
Why would I want to wait so long just for it to load?

00:01:45.214 --> 00:01:49.366
My no my phone sucks it overheats too easily

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:53.888
It takes forever to load. 

00:01:53.888 --> 00:01:56.200
Yeah, and the thing is...

00:01:57.128 --> 00:01:59.896
See, I have a limit, you clearly don't.

00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:09.649
You guys are judging me and yet you're doing this.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.974
You ,you are you are 

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:21.935
Yeah. Cuz that is

00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:24.972
Yeah, it takes like 30 minutes.

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:29.478
It takes like 30 minutes.

00:02:29.478 --> 00:02:33.055
That's like five minutes I wouldn't complain that's like normal time. See

00:02:33.055 --> 00:02:37.865
That's the reason why I stopped playing Cookie Run Kingdom, because after like 10 minutes, it kicks me out the game!

00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:42.539
Kicks me out. Well, there's no point in playing cuz every time I pull which is like 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:47.535
So I keep losing my gems I don't even get anything in return

00:02:47.535 --> 00:02:51.027
And I don't know what I'm gonna kick it 

00:02:53.693 --> 00:02:55.871
It's just a device problem.

00:02:57.626 --> 00:03:00.527
I can't do that every single time it happens.

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:08.139
So really for like what, a thousand gems? That's really sad.

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:12.898
like i would look that's like (***) . No, that's like something

00:03:12.898 --> 00:03:17.066
yeah like the first year that i played for it it was fine but then the second year

00:03:17.066 --> 00:03:19.579
It started kicking me out for like...

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.718
yeah it kicked me out so then i was like okay maybe something has

00:03:22.718 --> 00:03:25.470
I searched it up, it's a common problem and then I fixed it.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.220
It's still a problem.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.911
Worse, Cuz every like 5 to 10 minutes now not even just 10 or 30

00:03:34.497 --> 00:03:37.230
I deleted it, I even like reset everything.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.694
I got rid of some of my apps because they said some of them interfere with the game.

00:03:52.823 --> 00:03:53.803
Oh, I have boostaxs

00:03:56.198 --> 00:03:58.020
I don't like it either. It's really annoying.

00:04:01.075 --> 00:04:04.889
It works. It works. That's all that matters.

00:04:06.898 --> 00:04:10.443
I tried using it for Genshin Impact.Hahaha

00:04:12.365 --> 00:04:16.280
Ice spice?

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.330
I don't like a bunch of games and then I try using it, but...

00:04:25.814 --> 00:04:30.285
Does Microsoft have Genshin? Huh? Microsoft? Yeah!

00:04:33.763 --> 00:04:35.854
So why did...

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:45.794
Okay, well you're just weird.

00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:49.439
Oh.

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:55.700
no i did have genshin and then i deleted it because i would be at the lowest graphics settings

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.945
I know it's everything but it would still be like uh-

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.145
I do a 360 like

00:05:03.765 --> 00:05:07.698
Really slow 

00:05:07.698 --> 00:05:12.693
My laptop isn't meant for gaming.It's just I use it for work

00:05:12.693 --> 00:05:16.996
And also, I dropped it like a hundred different times. The screen...

00:05:17.127 --> 00:05:17.812
hahah..

00:05:17.873 --> 00:05:20.017
Haahaahaa..

00:05:26.801 --> 00:05:31.340
My brother he has a whole PC and a whole gaming setup because

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.845
Yeah, he even has a line of keyboards and like the little pads for the hahaha

00:05:35.845 --> 00:05:38.900
Who are you?

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.414
All you need is like those really like hand forms

00:05:41.414 --> 00:05:46.588
like mouses. And it'd be perfect . Brotherrr...

00:05:49.768 --> 00:05:54.763
Bro, only does play games. That's all he does

00:05:58.323 --> 00:06:02.845
I can get a good setup, I'm just- I don't wanna- I don't wanna look. I'm too lazy.

00:06:08.195 --> 00:06:10.962
Yeah I've seen that.

00:06:12.633 --> 00:06:14.760
It's already closed.
