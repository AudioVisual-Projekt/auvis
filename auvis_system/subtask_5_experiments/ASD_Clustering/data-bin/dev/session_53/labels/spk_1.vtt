You know I have ssssss

00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:13.354
 Kayla's doing the Greek Sonata, I think.

00:04:13.354 --> 00:04:15.814
I think she's doing the green sonata.

00:04:16.425 --> 00:04:21.385
I mean France Sonata is pretty task, you know, ch France Sonata is like

00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:26.380

Yeah, I feel like he's usually nice.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.045
That's good. It's hard to tell what he wants us to do.

00:05:06.157 --> 00:05:07.875
 Like, I don't know. I don't know why 

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:12.399

I think 

00:05:39.533 --> 00:05:41.340
I think we should

00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:47.937
I don't know. I feel like even if we question him why he doesn't let us do it. I feel like

00:05:47.937 --> 00:05:50.569
But never gave us like answer

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:52.473

00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:58.738
Oh, did he tell you?

00:06:02.081 --> 00:06:05.841
