WEBVTT

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:23.936
yay

00:00:27.132 --> 00:00:30.963
umm like

00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:35.754
Okay, like, I'm searching for ages of years, like, out of the islands I'm currently on.

00:00:35.754 --> 00:00:38.304
out of all of them currently or like from before?

00:00:42.504 --> 00:00:44.394
Oh, it was so good.

00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:58.352
I'm a low-key dollar parent, and I think Harv's so hard for Cosmo.

00:00:58.352 --> 00:01:01.608
because everyone was fighting so hard for him because they thought

00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:06.602
(****) like the little 

00:01:06.603 --> 00:01:11.599
So I i 

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:11.647
you

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:18.956
Literally, no, because I farmed the boss so hard. I memorized the entire map.

00:01:18.987 --> 00:01:22.159
I remember the boss was just high-fiving me and then I got like

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:27.123
Except for talents, but like I got all those

00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:32.115
And then I was building pity on my bed before him, and I got Yoimiya instead.

00:01:32.085 --> 00:01:37.028
And I didn't have enough to get positive after.

00:01:37.028 --> 00:01:42.022
The urge! The urge!

00:01:42.022 --> 00:01:46.581
the urge the urge to gamble  ohhh

00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:51.034
I got him later anyways. I got him later and he saw us.

00:01:52.301 --> 00:01:55.457
Oh my god, my health. He just pulled. It is like so on point.

00:01:55.457 --> 00:01:58.897
on his first free run and (***)

00:01:58.897 --> 00:02:01.412
umm 30 feet each.

00:02:01.412 --> 00:02:05.463
30-30 each 50-50

00:02:06.156 --> 00:02:08.010
ohhhh

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.960
Wait, I joined in 1.3 on who's house goes better, so I didn't blink.

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.021
My biggest regret is pulling child as my first

00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:27.991
hahahha

00:02:35.094 --> 00:02:39.482
That's your, like, starting camera. That's not your sound.

00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:56.846
wait they are like the way they are like..

00:02:56.846 --> 00:03:01.640
changed the (***) kinda annoying but like..

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.635
thats like cause like  different traveler have different capabilities 

00:03:06.635 --> 00:03:11.022
Like, Levine does more base attack damage, or like, either like...

00:03:11.022 --> 00:03:14.177
He like climbs stuff faster, he's better with his stamina.

00:03:14.177 --> 00:03:18.007
and then also like in other games similar to it they let you like change

00:03:23.256 --> 00:03:25.078
umm (****)

00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:38.089
No, of course not. Okay, but like, actually...

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:41.515
My favorite character right now is...

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.138
My favorite region is... This is so far back.

00:03:46.138 --> 00:03:51.134
like your first question for me was  my favourite region for the longest time

00:03:51.134 --> 00:03:54.762
as well but then i like..

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.476
and I'm absolutely in love with the nation now.

00:03:58.507 --> 00:04:03.114
(*****) 100 expolration Exploration out of all of

00:04:03.114 --> 00:04:08.042
yeah i have like really..

00:04:08.042 --> 00:04:11.468
I guess that's the only nation I have 100% in one area.

00:04:11.468 --> 00:04:14.927
It's not the entire nation, but one of the sections.

00:04:17.932 --> 00:04:22.673
It's the one with the weird lake and then it's like a dire valley.

00:04:22.673 --> 00:04:26.151
It's like a big quest surrounding it too

00:04:30.723 --> 00:04:35.718
That's different. The other side. The right side. Yeah, the right side of the mouth.

00:04:35.718 --> 00:04:38.233
Yeah.

00:04:38.233 --> 00:04:41.033
Me neither. I got 100% and then I went back.

00:04:41.033 --> 00:04:44.408
i am back here while later I found another chest. so i was like

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.521
It was a common gas. It was a common gas.

00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:09.418
Like, that was not a nice one

00:05:12.134 --> 00:05:16.471
Like the world, the world, the world hurts. those what?

00:05:21.735 --> 00:05:25.516
I never really knew that, actually. I always ignore the rules.

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:37.665
i Drop the game whenn..

00:05:37.666 --> 00:05:42.188
felt like a chore to log on every day. Because every day I would log on due to the four commissions.

00:05:42.187 --> 00:05:46.187
and then I'd log off and at that point I was like, I don't like the game anymore.

00:05:46.187 --> 00:05:49.057
i have 15

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:51.774
 I'm at 58

00:05:52.432 --> 00:05:57.427
Yeah, no, because when I was around the time I quit was the time that the first person got

00:05:57.427 --> 00:06:01.612
to AR60. Everyone's like oh my gosh it's the first AR60.

00:06:01.612 --> 00:06:04.346
So at the time, I was really high-ranked, but then like...

00:06:04.346 --> 00:06:07.603
umm i stopped playing for a while and then everyones ar60..

00:06:10.423 --> 00:06:13.223
Yeah, no, like, everyone, like, even if it's like,

00:06:13.254 --> 00:06:17.543
a year and a half already at my level, and I was like, dang, you guys went fast 

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:22.064
There's so much more to do because for us, we were like at a standstill.

00:06:22.064 --> 00:06:25.456
nation with a nation there's only two or three at the time

00:06:25.487 --> 00:06:30.483
So then when you finish the Archon quest, the only thing you do is explore, and that's

00:06:30.451 --> 00:06:34.552
of like the most efficient way to get like exp.

00:06:45.216 --> 00:06:49.807
no no i  I feel like there should be manners for like, different like...

00:06:49.807 --> 00:06:53.653
differentv(*****)

00:06:55.358 --> 00:07:00.353
yeah but like she betters but one is  lowerl level card but other one is harder level card

00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:05.298
but u can be like a really high level and not have 

00:07:05.298 --> 00:07:06.531
the story.
