00:00:19.698 --> 00:00:24.694
So where were we again? Genshin Impact, very unplugged game.

00:00:24.694 --> 00:00:29.097
What was your favorite reason? 

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:43.525
All of them, including the Lunatic-Hype ones, like Goldeneye, Father,archipelago, Archipelago 2.

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:46.260
I look every summer.

00:00:47.845 --> 00:00:51.794
I think every time I only start playing it until after all this stuff has ended.

00:00:51.794 --> 00:00:54.444
I can only open it in July

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:09.092
We got a cousin.

00:01:11.653 --> 00:01:16.193
And it's so easy to get

00:01:35.602 --> 00:01:39.247
Why do you build pity on another banner? Just wait!

00:01:39.247 --> 00:01:42.352
You can't wait to go gambling.

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:47.196
You don't need to go gambling immediately. You can wait to go gambling.

00:01:47.196 --> 00:01:49.913
okay

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:06.670
I think I got him in like 10 pity after Hu Pao.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.135
I think my biggest regret over the years has still been...

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:20.136
When I pre-installed, I didn't get Venti on his first map.

00:02:20.945 --> 00:02:23.054
I think I still have venti

00:02:25.214 --> 00:02:28.843
hahaha Thats just unfortunate.

00:02:29.838 --> 00:02:33.939
I think my first letter was Aether.

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:39.457
yeah i think second one

00:02:39.457 --> 00:02:43.963
I don't remember my second one. I think it might have been like... Putao?

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:48.874
Because it had a big gap. I quit during I think clear albedo. I didn't get out of them

00:02:48.874 --> 00:02:51.473
and when I rejoined, it was basically just True Talent.

00:02:51.557 --> 00:02:55.488
I think you got chow like the next banner after

00:03:19.941 --> 00:03:23.130
Wait, can you do it in Zenless or in StarRail?

00:03:26.774 --> 00:03:30.420
Number one in waves still isn't it?

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.102
It's similar, but it still isnt way worse

00:04:03.124 --> 00:04:05.503
Even Monsta X?

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.535
yeah which region though?

00:04:26.512 --> 00:04:29.145
The one with the little guy?

00:04:32.925 --> 00:04:34.208
The one that's in the valley?

00:04:36.586 --> 00:04:40.400
I don't know what it's called. huh

00:04:44.247 --> 00:04:46.881
I sometimes respond. Like even if you...

00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:50.829
even if you go through and clear all the like ultimate chests you can still go back like

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:53.225
A week later, they'll respond.

00:04:54.288 --> 00:04:57.242
Okay, Lilz, respond even faster.

00:04:58.913 --> 00:05:01.477
See the main thing for uhh

00:05:01.477 --> 00:05:05.240
100% is just the selkies and all the bigger chests.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.295
all the planets the storylines and stuff like that

00:05:08.295 --> 00:05:11.687
Do you know that sometimes there's also random challenges? Those too.

00:05:13.864 --> 00:05:16.513
yeah huh They're like

00:05:16.513 --> 00:05:21.136
Those also count, right? Like, just a rather common test will just, like, respond sometimes.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.191
I looked into it because I think there was a time where I was trying to 100%.

00:05:28.191 --> 00:05:31.735
All the reasons when I got bored and then I dropped the game

00:05:31.735 --> 00:05:35.160
And then more regions came out, and then I quit.

00:05:46.415 --> 00:05:49.081
But what AR are you at? 

00:06:07.525 --> 00:06:11.222
Everybody and their mom is at like at least AR-55.

00:06:16.747 --> 00:06:18.635
i mean

00:06:33.936 --> 00:06:36.771
I think my least favorite part about the newer version is that...

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:41.614
all the quests have such a low level requirement because what people pull

00:06:41.614 --> 00:06:46.609
Ugh, not one character. How am I supposed to get the materials for them, if I can't reach not one?

00:06:46.609 --> 00:06:46.643
you

00:06:53.071 --> 00:06:56.093
They should be like a level of requirement.

00:07:00.074 --> 00:07:02.235
Cause like the max level is still what, 90?
