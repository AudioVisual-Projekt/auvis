WEBVTT

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:22.188
So yeah, you don't think it's weird at all?

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.264
Like

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:35.554
Okay, okay, okay, so reasons why I'm afraid to text him.

00:00:35.554 --> 00:00:40.531
A.he  Lowkey does not like me.

00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:42.051
B.

00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:45.673
mmm

00:00:47.905 --> 00:00:49.255
What if hes

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:54.521
Wait, I left someone red?

00:00:59.414 --> 00:01:03.127
Would you actually not take it? Because I would have taken it. Like genuinely.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.654
That's so funny!

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:15.649
okay b.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.125
It's way too weird because

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:24.119
We're from two completely sides, two completely different sides.

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.651
of the state. of state

00:01:28.524 --> 00:01:32.017
But then, okay, let's say something were to happen. It's gonna be like...

00:01:32.288 --> 00:01:35.511
Like eat it and, you know?

00:01:35.511 --> 00:01:39.949
Be my discord kitten, yeah?

00:01:50.107 --> 00:01:55.035
Okay, but then, what if we don't? Worst case scenario, it's gonna be like, 8 years.

00:01:56.452 --> 00:01:59.085
Eight years, nothing.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.610
Yeah that's true. umm

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:15.217
It would be very awkward.

00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:19.925
Because we go to different schools from different sides.

00:02:20.617 --> 00:02:22.456
is just not interesting.

00:02:35.198 --> 00:02:35.821
and

00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:42.336
Okay, so I was thinking

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.617
That..

00:02:44.124 --> 00:02:48.646
 maybe , maybe 

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:52.308
Maybe oh, I forgot to say see you

00:02:52.308 --> 00:02:55.649
I don't even know if there's a seat. but

00:02:59.362 --> 00:03:01.877
No!

00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:05.747
I don't think that's necessary, but I don't know what to say

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.005
Maybe once Cardi drops, I have music.  Oh.

00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:14.077
You know, fun fact about Playboi Carti.

00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:17.891
He has been saying this since last year, like late, late last year.

00:03:18.145 --> 00:03:22.211
He was like, guys, guys, I'm gonna drop a new album.

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:27.527
And he kept saying, guys, it's gonna be soon.

00:03:27.527 --> 00:03:31.070
And then Kendrick Lamar dropped G and X.

00:03:31.101 --> 00:03:36.096
Like with no publicizing, no advertisement.

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:39.610
Um so Cardi was like

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.190
Oh shoot, Kendrick just dropped.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.684
So half my fanbase is like obsessed with Kendrick now.

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:51.439
So he's been saved. Don't worry guys!

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.417
Errm...

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:58.020
I'm gonna drop a new year. He has no drugs, so maybe he's just not gonna drop the album.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.956
Yeah, yeah

00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:07.639
or if lamp drops a new album.

00:04:11.654 --> 00:04:14.996
Low-key though, I mean honestly though

00:04:15.385 --> 00:04:19.349
The messages, I mean not the messages, the notes.

00:04:19.688 --> 00:04:22.589
of the songs that he posts on his

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:25.324
Instagram are actually really like

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:28.664
They're pretty solid salt, I'm not gonna lie.

00:04:31.635 --> 00:04:36.258
right right Right, you're so right

00:04:36.495 --> 00:04:37.558
umm

00:04:39.515 --> 00:04:42.806
I agree. But still...

00:04:42.806 --> 00:04:45.928
yeah stop

00:04:45.928 --> 00:04:49.606
so umm'

00:04:49.606 --> 00:04:53.438
Okay, but

00:04:53.438 --> 00:04:57.572
I don't think like the best case scenario

00:04:58.347 --> 00:05:00.693
Okay, like what's the best case scenario, you know?

00:05:04.474 --> 00:05:07.630
Okay, okay, let's say best case scenario.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.460
Yay! It happens. Worst case scenario.

00:05:17.568 --> 00:05:20.690
Yeah, because that would be like the third time in a row.

00:05:24.808 --> 00:05:25.989
I know.

00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:33.515
Yeah, I was talking to Todd and he said oh

00:05:33.515 --> 00:05:36.536
he just forgot maybe

00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:47.657
But then when you realize you didn't send it, don't you send it anyway?

00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:56.668
i I agree.

00:06:02.507 --> 00:06:06.692
Yeah.umm I don't know what to say.

00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:11.582
ohh its ohhh she is in tracking field 

00:06:11.551 --> 00:06:14.657
And it's track season right now

00:06:16.193 --> 00:06:20.546
Yeah, well I only knew that because I stopped.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.101
Eye music, yeah. uhuh

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:40.611
Maybe not about Shag, that's like weird, I don't know anything about Shag.

00:06:43.715 --> 00:06:46.212
No, I don't want to lie to him.

00:06:46.212 --> 00:06:49.419
That's like, that's funny

00:06:52.726 --> 00:06:55.224
Yeah, okay. Well, I should ask.

00:06:55.224 --> 00:06:59.645
Oh wait, I already know what he does. He runs the 100 and 200 meters.

00:07:03.678 --> 00:07:07.813
That's legible. Maybe when it happens.
