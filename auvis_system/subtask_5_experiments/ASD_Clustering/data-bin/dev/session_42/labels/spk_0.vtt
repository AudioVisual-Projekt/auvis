00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.074

00:01:00.618 --> 00:01:02.560

00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:28.075

00:01:31.484 --> 00:01:35.516

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:42.385

00:01:42.385 --> 00:01:47.329

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.766
Wait, because last year she put like balloons everywhere in her classroom.

00:01:52.358 --> 00:01:55.749
Okay, but like

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:59.462
I like the Jeopardy, I like the Kahoot!

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.204
Wait, at the end of every unit we play Jeopardy.

00:02:13.754 --> 00:02:16.252
Maybe that was at the end, but like she would...

00:02:16.252 --> 00:02:20.268
I played a lot of games in her past.

00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:27.339
Yeah.

00:02:37.768 --> 00:02:41.429
That's so sad

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.349
So like, she's doing it. 

00:02:54.204 --> 00:02:57.529
(****) but like

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:01.714
I don't know. I like the key terms.

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:03.689
I think those are useful.

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:12.143
. So weird.

00:03:12.143 --> 00:03:15.923
But I mean if you didn't use AI to take you like an hour

00:03:15.923 --> 00:03:20.530
Because you need to go through the textbook

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.517
 Yeah.

00:03:26.013 --> 00:03:30.351
It's all boring. 

00:03:30.351 --> 00:03:33.642
I don't like it.

00:03:36.274 --> 00:03:40.375
ohh

00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:44.357
Yeah, it's not good. And then, wait, but like last year she made a form and she like...

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:46.871
Do you even use a textbook?and i i

00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:51.546
If everyone was truthful, everyone would have put no. but like

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.561
Wait, but I put the I put no but

00:04:02.143 --> 00:04:05.096
and then..

00:04:05.096 --> 00:04:07.577
What else did she do last year?

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.525
Do people even answer questions like the smart people do?

00:04:21.314 --> 00:04:23.270
That's not bad

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.400
Wait, yeah. But like, none of them are interesting. Wait, cause...

00:04:39.117 --> 00:04:42.997
yeah but..

00:04:42.997 --> 00:04:46.085
I thought she was depressed at the start because no one was answering her questions.

00:04:57.037 --> 00:04:59.484
What area?

00:05:00.902 --> 00:05:05.508
what? Also, this is a colonization.

00:05:08.395 --> 00:05:11.213
But I feel like hard to emcee is hard.

00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:15.532
(****)

00:05:32.324 --> 00:05:34.754
wait but like..

00:05:35.294 --> 00:05:40.035
but like she pulled it very hard last year like if u didnt say..

00:05:40.035 --> 00:05:43.748
yeah cause like  People would get like...

00:05:43.747 --> 00:05:47.528
it's like seven points

00:05:52.506 --> 00:05:56.268
yeah so people would get like 20s or 15s glasses

00:05:56.268 --> 00:06:01.179
sometimes (***)

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:04.960
like the first one I knew I got like the

00:06:05.095 --> 00:06:09.432
2015 (****)

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.527
what?

00:06:22.527 --> 00:06:25.968
I think you guys just sucked. I think she sucked enough for you guys.

00:06:30.254 --> 00:06:34.912
but like

00:06:35.335 --> 00:06:40.330
Do you think you'll be screwed for the test?

00:06:43.316 --> 00:06:47.602
what?

00:06:56.412 --> 00:06:59.583
Oh it's digital.

00:06:59.583 --> 00:07:01.559
Wait, but that's way easier.

00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:08.650
what?
