WEBVTT

00:00:11.295 --> 00:00:13.791
ah I missed the whistle.

00:00:14.695 --> 00:00:18.550
Mm Okay I guess it's okay

00:00:21.386 --> 00:00:25.739
Yeah, I've had- My own teacher did at Royal Academy too.

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.367
My teacher before Jacob did that for an academy.

00:00:31.062 --> 00:00:34.363
But she was she was very young. So she didn't like it

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:37.627
She went

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:41.500
For like the college program which was like

00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:46.495
They feel, yeah, she went

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.276
she went out of the college, but

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.975
what? yeah

00:00:57.903 --> 00:01:01.834
Oh Yeah, yeah, yeah, she was a junior

00:01:07.347 --> 00:01:08.871
Why is she here?

00:01:13.343 --> 00:01:18.339
Piano? Oh, I didn't know she

00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:27.688
Interesting.

00:01:28.403 --> 00:01:31.214
But like low-key I can I can see it

00:01:31.214 --> 00:01:34.455
Like if someone told me to see it, I can see it.

00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:39.449
like the nerdiness and like the willingness to talk so much about music

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:44.175
I feel like I can kind of see it, but

00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:45.722
Juilliard is crazy. 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.333
24? Oh, she just graduated

00:01:52.668 --> 00:01:54.082
That's interesting

00:01:55.464 --> 00:01:59.717
On the other hand, John Hollywood did not even graduate in music.

00:02:01.223 --> 00:02:04.711
Yeah, but he's way cooler. He's just better.

00:02:05.716 --> 00:02:09.807
Oh, I didn't know. Oh, I didn't know

00:02:11.337 --> 00:02:14.971
I wonder why they would choose to come here. Maybe it's because it's like LA

00:02:16.337 --> 00:02:17.672
***

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.232
Right, yeah, yeah, yeah. Or like East Coast, Boston.

00:02:25.232 --> 00:02:27.039
Boston is a nice place

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.502
Boston is nice. I liked it when I went. 

00:02:33.212 --> 00:02:36.892
feels a little more like

00:02:36.892 --> 00:02:38.984
Organized and elevated.

00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:42.058
 just a little more

00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:45.111
mmmm

00:02:46.152 --> 00:02:50.257
Europe was a little ***. yeah

00:02:50.257 --> 00:02:53.248
I feel like Boston was like a good balance.

00:02:55.472 --> 00:03:00.466
But I don't know. I know, right like

00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:02.777
MSM. MSM would be fun too.

00:03:04.986 --> 00:03:06.452
I think she did.

00:03:08.297 --> 00:03:12.700
mm, I want to, yeah, I think ah

00:03:14.067 --> 00:03:18.708
Yeah, yeah. She is from ***. I don't know where Isaac is.

00:03:22.277 --> 00:03:28.276
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. ***

00:03:31.916 --> 00:03:36.512
College in Fullerton, the professor at Fullerton's

00:03:36.512 --> 00:03:39.936
A really good professor. Yeah

00:03:39.936 --> 00:03:43.277
He his name is Moni Semyonov.

00:03:44.578 --> 00:03:48.459
And I think he studied on in Midori.

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.972
And he's like Midori's right hand.

00:03:52.592 --> 00:03:53.663
Izzy so make a lot of stir-fry

00:03:54.078 --> 00:03:59.073
I think he coached he coached my brother's *** so like seniors

00:03:59.073 --> 00:04:02.297
And he was going to coach them to...

00:04:02.297 --> 00:04:04.828
Fish shops, junior junior fish shops.

00:04:07.935 --> 00:04:10.650
somehow... some

00:04:12.758 --> 00:04:15.509
Following ey yeah

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:20.049
but i hear that like he might step down from the position so i don't know

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.470
Because I think he's like carrying the cold burn.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.060
Like Colburn chamber director position and

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.887
Cal State Fullerton like strings director position so i think

00:04:33.887 --> 00:04:38.476
I heard through a grapevine that he might be stepping out. I will

00:04:38.476 --> 00:04:40.906
But he's like super good

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.605
Well, that's the only person I know from Portland. But, 

00:04:47.605 --> 00:04:50.730
Fullerton technically has a music department.

00:04:50.654 --> 00:04:55.536
Yeah, sorry, kind of makes sense but um i think

00:04:55.536 --> 00:04:57.186
I feel like

00:04:58.052 --> 00:05:01.105
He oh, he he has an Instagram account?

00:05:01.105 --> 00:05:05.015
called zen violin and he like creates like ***

00:05:04.903 --> 00:05:08.783
exercises so like tune certain passages.

00:05:08.783 --> 00:05:12.733
And stuff. And he posts it online. And I use it sometimes.

00:05:12.733 --> 00:05:15.298
And he has a nice shirt um

00:05:15.298 --> 00:05:19.262
he has an excerpt like except the

00:05:19.262 --> 00:05:20.761
except the

00:05:21.024 --> 00:05:26.603
Conquer excerpt kind of website, excerpt exercises.

00:05:26.603 --> 00:05:31.110
like he has he has and like he has a like

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.973
set of like works like exercises you should do

00:05:34.973 --> 00:05:36.748
for a certain exit.

00:05:37.162 --> 00:05:41.656
But, he only has it for like the big ones so like Don Juan, Schumann, Mozart

00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:45.351
and then like bombs 4 I think. But yeah.

00:05:45.351 --> 00:05:48.862
that I used it for learning the cochlear implant.

00:05:48.862 --> 00:05:53.334
It was pretty... it was, it was pretty spot on like. It helped me.

00:05:53.334 --> 00:05:58.329
but like some of the fingerings i didn't really like so yeah

00:05:58.329 --> 00:06:03.105
And some of the exercises are like based off the fingering that he gives so it's like

00:06:03.105 --> 00:06:08.100
not always helpful but like there are things that like help with like shifting or

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.702
more like bow bow control stuff.
