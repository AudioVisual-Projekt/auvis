00:00:07.888 --> 00:00:11.583
Yeah, because no one else wants to talk with you.

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:02.850
So basically told them resign.

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:05.803
Leave the club? Let someone else do it?

00:01:05.804 --> 00:01:08.318
And they'll probably love her.

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:13.267
At least cancel out all the old stuff that you personally started and turned into an issue.

00:01:41.882 --> 00:01:44.565
That's so bad.

00:01:47.423 --> 00:01:50.477
Like it's not even, like, why, why would, first of all...

00:01:50.421 --> 00:01:55.079
Why wouldn't they go to the coach or the advisors, right? Why did they go to the alumni?

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.419
who's currently a college freshman trying to get through his classes

00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:03.398
That are like insanely hard and has better things to do than worry about his high school that club that he

00:02:03.398 --> 00:02:07.987
Graduated from already I should have had like no stuff left to do with them and that's

00:02:07.987 --> 00:02:10.012
It's like they're still pulling him back in.

00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:17.084
Do you know how long it took for him to respond?

00:02:20.812 --> 00:02:25.369
Okay, it would've been worse if like, he tried ignoring them and then they sent a follow-up saying...

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:27.867
Please respond soon.

00:02:34.818 --> 00:02:36.877
A week?

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:42.935
okay i think he might have been trying to ignore it but then he like remembered it

00:02:44.673 --> 00:02:46.952
That or they DM him on Discord.

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:54.833
Who did you hear that from?

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:01.262
Can you guess why he might have that opinion?

00:03:01.262 --> 00:03:06.190
It's like, I DM, he'll respond. If that guy responds

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.594
He responds . Like this guy DMed him about Tcap last year and he respond

00:03:10.594 --> 00:03:12.163
about the Metro Internship.

00:03:12.804 --> 00:03:16.584
Metro like and he responded to price

00:03:16.584 --> 00:03:20.905
Can you guess why he might not want to respond to Bowie and Siri?

00:03:21.546 --> 00:03:25.899
Yeah, he responds , he checks discord.

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:30.151
like he's on discord like normally i think but it's like

00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:34.956
There's no read receipt, read receipt, so you can easily ignore anyone.

00:03:40.732 --> 00:03:44.799
But they might have tried DMing him and they said, all right, I'll just do the email.

00:03:54.806 --> 00:03:57.405
Oh yeah, did he keep trying to pull new coaches?

00:03:57.405 --> 00:04:01.034
because I guess they don't like Mr. Demi even though are things supposed to be that

00:04:01.034 --> 00:04:06.029
student run, we're mostly doing stuff ourselves, we get occasional advice from our mentor.

00:04:06.057 --> 00:04:08.942
Let them do like, don't like that or post because they suck.

00:04:08.913 --> 00:04:11.429
And so they're trying to put a new coach to do everything for them.

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:14.246
And it's like, that's not how it's supposed to go.

00:04:14.246 --> 00:04:16.929
and they're just like throwing everything away.

00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:22.735
Trying to make Whitney into a thing that it's not.

00:04:22.735 --> 00:04:26.632
meant to be like i think it's not was not has not ever been known to me

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:39.452
Back when who wait back when who was where?

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.486
We? They were never there.

00:04:44.858 --> 00:04:49.666
And also that's and then you're trying to go against the things that have made it happen

00:04:49.666 --> 00:04:50.865
Thank you

00:04:52.113 --> 00:04:56.704
No, like they think, like Sheena is not gonna be the next Ian Hudson.

00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:02.474
Ian Hudson was the guy who was held in...

00:05:02.474 --> 00:05:06.120
Sophomore year, junior year, senior year and he took them to awards all three years.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.870
That was Ian Hudson.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.097
I don't remember, but he did that.

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.067
and then it's like they keep trying to do stuff that they can't do

00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:20.986
they keep looking back at the history of water but it's like

00:05:20.986 --> 00:05:25.543
They don't know to see the culture of it and how they're like the antithesis of that culture.

00:05:27.197 --> 00:05:31.416
like they keep trying to do other stuff or if they keep trying to do other stuff they'll still

00:05:31.444 --> 00:05:36.439
Or like, they keep, like, Sadat just keeps doing other stuff, and then, you know, our actual president is just a bum.

00:05:39.077 --> 00:05:42.738
Even if her heart is in the right place

00:05:42.767 --> 00:05:46.817
She's not doing any of the right thing

00:05:58.786 --> 00:06:03.259
No seriously, (****) Probably as low as 2, no?

00:06:03.287 --> 00:06:04.941
He's also doing tennis, right?

00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:11.611
I don't know but he probably ignores this one anyways.

00:06:17.332 --> 00:06:21.315
Oh, then she very clearly has a favorite child.

00:06:21.315 --> 00:06:24.656
And it's 1 out of 15 and she ignores the rest of them
