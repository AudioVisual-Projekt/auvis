00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:27.600
(***) Oh I see

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.395
Is it the one where like one of them is like dying?

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:34.956
yeah the hospital one

00:00:38.197 --> 00:00:41.622
I saw like trailers of it and it looked really sad.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.037
I was like, that looks so cool.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.212

00:00:57.873 --> 00:00:59.661
Oh yeah.

00:01:10.276 --> 00:01:12.791

00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:17.010
Have you seen... shoot.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.558
What was it called again?

00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:24.580
You know that one, like, I don't think it's a, is it a Ghibli film? I don't think so. It's too sad for that

00:01:24.552 --> 00:01:28.112
Like the fireflies one?

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:33.564
It's like so many fireflies.

00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:38.586
That was such a sad movie. It's...

00:01:38.558 --> 00:01:41.124
No, but the thing is... Okay.

00:01:41.124 --> 00:01:45.106
Then I'll just spoil it for you. Just spoil it for you.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.472
its really sad like

00:01:50.472 --> 00:01:55.147
 they were the fireflies..Like I watched it because I saw a few reviews

00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:58.218
He's about to (****) and

00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:03.213
Oh, it was so sad. See, the beginning was so happy.

00:02:03.213 --> 00:02:07.871
oh so sweet and then ohhh

00:02:10.874 --> 00:02:12.966
Brother!

00:02:14.282 --> 00:02:17.978
Well, everybody's like actually getting part of the live. It's crazy.

00:02:26.584 --> 00:02:28.947
I've heard of it.

00:02:31.226 --> 00:02:35.023
Oh, I thought about player one

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.135
It's okay, but I didn't really get the ending. like the ending..It was like...

00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:49.130
you're giving it to the people but like that was never really the issue i think

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.180
you

00:02:51.807 --> 00:02:56.785
I watched it twice and I like never really got it

00:03:00.825 --> 00:03:05.820
It's really cool to watch. It's really fun.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.060
I don't know what they're trying to say.

00:03:12.906 --> 00:03:17.901
Yeah, he completes a few missions. Wow, he saved the world.

00:03:17.901 --> 00:03:21.480
And he also has a girlfriend I guess.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.475
Yeah, lowkey that girl could have done better.

00:03:32.954 --> 00:03:36.903
I know.

00:03:44.834 --> 00:03:45.424
Yeah.

00:03:48.816 --> 00:03:51.129
Mmm.

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.495
she is straight...

00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:08.758
I don't know why movies add a whole love block.

00:04:08.841 --> 00:04:11.355
for when i like i like

00:04:11.327 --> 00:04:15.851
Talk to people about movies. They're like, I don't know why they added a whole like subplot where there's romance

00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:17.959
even though it's unnecessary.

00:04:23.023 --> 00:04:28.018
I know and it's like, I feel like it takes away from the room.

00:04:33.214 --> 00:04:37.551
It's also always at the sacrifice of like the female lead too.

00:04:37.551 --> 00:04:42.546
Suddenly she's like like the damsel in distress like she literally has no other personality

00:04:42.436 --> 00:04:45.474
Oh, I'm the guy's girlfriend now.

00:04:48.942 --> 00:04:50.933
Oh yeah.

00:04:52.976 --> 00:04:56.115
yeah like

00:04:56.115 --> 00:04:59.827
really but like I liked her in the beginning 

00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:03.561
When she was like low-key just like struggling.

00:05:03.533 --> 00:05:06.098
When she was like talking with everybody.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.065
because  Howl wasn't in the picture just yet but then as soon as Howl

00:05:11.065 --> 00:05:13.175
howl kind of goes into the picture.

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:19.014
and then she does like take control when she needs to but 

00:05:36.716 --> 00:05:40.091
I watched Endgame first!

00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:43.111
She's a really good marble like

00:05:43.111 --> 00:05:47.111
She's like, you wanna watch Endgame with me? He's like, yeah sure, I've never seen the movies.

00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:50.974
So I literally don't know anything, and I watched Endgame.

00:05:50.974 --> 00:05:55.092
And then watch the second one. Huh?

00:05:55.065 --> 00:05:58.035
Oh absolutely, I already knew most of the lore anyways.

00:05:58.063 --> 00:06:00.577
no like

00:06:00.577 --> 00:06:03.260
Yeah

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:16.642
I watched the first one. Yeah, like Endgame, and then...

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:21.300
Isn't there two parts to it?

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.627
Yeah, and then
