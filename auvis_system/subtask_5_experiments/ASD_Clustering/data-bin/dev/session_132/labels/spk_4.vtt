WEBVTT

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.320
Pocket edition.

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.931
Pcket edition

00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:35.166
I played both. I played ***

00:00:40.077 --> 00:00:45.071
Yeah. Huhu

00:00:45.797 --> 00:00:48.834
Yeah. Stravet is better

00:00:49.331 --> 00:00:50.743
Mm mm

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.065
Is all you're gonna do, are you gonna just mock me the whole time?

00:00:54.065 --> 00:00:57.559
***Let us do more

00:01:02.648 --> 00:01:05.810
Yeah. Just a little discussion

00:01:10.873 --> 00:01:11.836
so,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.241
Huhuh

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.435
ch ahm...

00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:22.854
***

00:01:24.336 --> 00:01:27.343
Ahw, I think Java is great.

00:01:27.343 --> 00:01:31.681
Because, you know, like survival and bedrock, everything's like given to you.

00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:36.676
***Java is better***

00:01:37.224 --> 00:01:41.602
*** No, it's different.

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:46.598
 Wait, but like, the rocks look different now, because I made it more similar to Java.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.373
See, all you do is ***

00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:04.529
yeah

00:02:05.464 --> 00:02:09.464
That's why it's worse than others. Yes did you think  *** for it

00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:13.062
okay

00:02:15.507 --> 00:02:18.776
 The Hive? The Hive sounds like

00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:20.452
Lowkey is like

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:23.992
Or it, it's not that good anymore.

00:02:23.992 --> 00:02:28.988
It used to be better. Then, I don't know what happened, it just got worse.

00:02:30.607 --> 00:02:32.802
uff, ended

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.353
Do I hated?

00:02:38.303 --> 00:02:42.622
No, I don't I don't , I don't really place any focus. I do worlds.

00:02:45.671 --> 00:02:46.691
yeah

00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:54.149
Hah, It was good, I really enjoyed it.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.347
But this

00:03:05.691 --> 00:03:07.412
What's the alphabet of the room?

00:03:11.503 --> 00:03:15.715
Well, I don't like the queue a lot. Okay

00:03:16.381 --> 00:03:17.841
It was like

00:03:20.018 --> 00:03:23.359
But for, I was in elementary right?

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:28.235
I got to set the scene. You know, I will set I'll

00:03:28.235 --> 00:03:33.426
I started, I started with playing 4th fret and 4th fret.

00:03:33.386 --> 00:03:37.805
***Like I, I was a kid.

00:03:37.805 --> 00:03:39.108
And then...

00:03:43.184 --> 00:03:44.908
It was like

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.335
I don't know what you want me to say.

00:03:51.742 --> 00:03:55.594
I was might. I don't know what else you want me to say.

00:04:02.087 --> 00:04:07.083
I finished the video though, I deleted the world after that one. Because it's scary.

00:04:07.592 --> 00:04:09.597
Imagine you're a kid

00:04:09.597 --> 00:04:12.229
you turn around after like strip mining for diamonds

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:16.414
You turn around and then you see her. Wouldn't you be scared?

00:04:17.035 --> 00:04:18.172
oh

00:04:24.227 --> 00:04:25.904
Hahahuh

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.885
Well I'm, hah, huh, I'm not the one trying to prove pure vice existent.

00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:36.479
I'm, I was just trying to play Minecraft. I was a kid.

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.224
I wasn't interested in that. I just wanted it like something high

00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:46.823
I know you don't understand the concept of fun, but I do.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:49.273
right

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.021
hah

00:04:54.357 --> 00:04:55.919
You're getting off topic.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.924
Huh, very much is worried.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.510
Mm, Well...

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.635
I think I saw him.

00:05:27.862 --> 00:05:31.575
Since, I don't know, maybe I'm like schizophrenic.

00:05:31.575 --> 00:05:34.849
I don't know what you want me to say. May be, I'm asking about your head.

00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:40.547
It's true, I saw her over there.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.530
Huh, That? Wait, but fourth grade, that's...

00:05:50.118 --> 00:05:52.044
Seven years ago.

00:05:52.044 --> 00:05:57.039
That's like out of relevance now. I feel like there's more people I like.

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:02.035
well power have like***I feel like my existence is no longer relevant.

00:06:02.035 --> 00:06:05.832
Well, and like a and like cute things

00:06:08.583 --> 00:06:10.826
Ah, Thank you, guys. I ***

He's trying so hard to be nice right now. I know you want to say like slurs at me.
