WEBVTT

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:46.960
So, I don't think it's that they're college minded.

00:00:47.228 --> 00:00:50.806
but that there's just a bunch of kids who are just a bunch of nerds.

00:00:50.457 --> 00:00:54.085
cause we have clean and flattered so many and then..

00:00:54.165 --> 00:00:57.676
Who else..?

00:00:57.676 --> 00:01:00.190
and then we have..

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.257
We have a bunch of other players.

00:01:04.257 --> 00:01:07.987
Huh? Sahir? I don't remember if it was Sahir 

00:01:07.987 --> 00:01:10.298
yeah

00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:17.439
Like, maximum, maybe. And then...

00:01:17.386 --> 00:01:21.453
Does Viva count? I don't think it counts he just referred 

00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:32.152
i know they are doing it off umm

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.171
Yeah, they're the only ones I really know they're doing.

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:42.827
Like, they're substituting a bunch of AD classes, especially like...

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:45.432
like mathhead (****)

00:01:56.751 --> 00:02:00.192
huh?

00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:03.630
ohh

00:02:03.818 --> 00:02:08.813
I don't know, people in our group just kind of know.

00:02:08.787 --> 00:02:13.528
its like we kinda know everybody kinda know

00:02:13.528 --> 00:02:16.718
(*****)

00:02:16.718 --> 00:02:21.713
Because they always like talking about it. They're like, oh, what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?

00:02:26.287 --> 00:02:31.281
I think I just like talking. Yeah, they just like talking on a show.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.912
 No, I don't like her classes

00:02:45.912 --> 00:02:50.873
classes are so bad because all she really does is she has a bunch of slides

00:02:50.873 --> 00:02:53.388
Because you don't miss Perry, right?

00:02:53.388 --> 00:02:57.606
(****) but she actually points it And it's actually relevant

00:02:57.606 --> 00:03:02.602
to what she's teaching and what's on the test, right? But for Verrett...

00:03:02.655 --> 00:03:06.030
She does a bunch of slides, but then she just stopped.

00:03:05.977 --> 00:03:09.622
And there's no substance behind it.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:13.283
You're better off going on YouTube, searching up

00:03:13.283 --> 00:03:18.278
push videos and they'll explain it to you better and more succinctly.

00:03:18.278 --> 00:03:20.894
And it's more relevant to the actual AP test.

00:03:20.894 --> 00:03:25.197
Because she's making us do forever queues that are Ellie queues

00:03:25.197 --> 00:03:28.099
They don't follow the guidelines.

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.762
like the AP test for US history.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.001
I think it's close. By the beginning of the year, a lot of the

00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:43.134
Didn't really follow the structure and what they want

00:03:43.134 --> 00:03:46.342
yeah it was strange and shes

00:03:46.342 --> 00:03:48.855
I'm also really bad at grading our essays.

00:03:48.855 --> 00:03:53.850
because like she's giving us mad scores but the thing is everybody always gets good scores

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.467
She's too easy of a grazer, so...

00:03:56.467 --> 00:04:01.461
You could write the worst essay of your life and she'll still give you like a 27 out of 20.

00:04:01.461 --> 00:04:01.580
you

00:04:04.701 --> 00:04:09.206
No, it's so easy just to like write random stuff and it works out.

00:04:09.206 --> 00:04:13.493
We just had an L.A.Q. yesterday and I wrote the worst essay I have ever written.

00:04:13.493 --> 00:04:18.489
ever written in my life and I'm pretty sure she's gonna give me at least a 25.

00:04:26.859 --> 00:04:31.449
I feel like she knows the content but honestly from what I've heard about her

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.582
for AP Art History, it makes me question whether or not she knows it.

00:04:35.582 --> 00:04:39.969
because she she knows like the names of art pieces but she'll

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:44.526
horribly like butchered their names like she called them by something else

00:04:44.526 --> 00:04:49.318
Because she doesn't want to call them by their name. just like....  You have the art team.

00:04:49.318 --> 00:04:52.660
history teacher and history teacher in general?

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.187
Should you know how to pronounce these things?

00:04:56.187 --> 00:05:00.845
Shouldn't you know how to correctly say these things given it's literally what you're teaching?

00:05:00.845 --> 00:05:05.012
it actually shows up on like the test They won't know what it is

00:05:05.012 --> 00:05:07.577
because you're using a different name for it.

00:05:10.024 --> 00:05:12.050
its really (*****)

00:05:15.374 --> 00:05:19.254
Yeah four , but everybody last year

00:05:19.254 --> 00:05:22.023
ap of history There are also

00:05:22.023 --> 00:05:25.144
They were basically saying, yeah, it's basically a self study class.

00:05:25.144 --> 00:05:28.249
And two weeks right before the AP test, all of them were fine.

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:32.839
Because apparently half the stuff they needed to learn wasn't taught in class.

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:37.581
Yeah, so all of them are like, oh, I need to self study all day.

00:05:38.576 --> 00:05:43.166
No, thank God. I was thinking of doing art history.

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:48.161
But then after I saw, after I heard what my friends were saying about the class, I was like,

00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:50.490
Never mind.

00:05:56.583 --> 00:05:59.350
I don't know, because I think a lot of them actually wanted to do like

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.641
They were actually interested in the material also.

00:06:02.641 --> 00:06:06.168
Not just for the credit, because I actually thought it would be an interesting class.

00:06:06.168 --> 00:06:09.661
But from what I've heard...

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:14.656
the topics they teach are Interesting which is that barrette isn't good at teaching

00:06:14.656 --> 00:06:18.199
teaching it thats like she was the teacher

00:06:23.396 --> 00:06:26.384
Don't you? He plays Minecraft

00:06:26.384 --> 00:06:31.379
Front row seat, front row seat to the right, next to Verret.

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:35.529
playing Minecraft Bed Wars. I see him playing Bed Wars all the time.
