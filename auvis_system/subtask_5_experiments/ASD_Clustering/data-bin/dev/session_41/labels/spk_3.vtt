WEBVTT

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.942
so hahahah

00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.809
I've heard this theory.

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.320
like every time and she would change all of them so it's like hmm

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.936
I wonder. i

00:00:53.205 --> 00:00:57.559
No, she has the random line too.

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.019
The one suspicious lie I remember well.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:07.059
Yeah.

00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:13.709
i dont know its been like..

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:18.011
The sky comes out really interesting but if there's no mountain I'm still not going back.

00:01:28.727 --> 00:01:33.722
Usually my style is just like, I don't look for, I don't theorize, I just see where the game goes.

00:01:36.928 --> 00:01:39.678
Like I'll read all the random theories

00:01:39.678 --> 00:01:44.674
But it's like, I think, wow, those are all like really interesting. I can't wait to see how his actions are printing out.

00:01:44.674 --> 00:01:47.965
And I'm like, I don't think any further.

00:02:05.446 --> 00:02:08.671
Sure, but make sure you yell them so everyone can hear.

00:02:10.475 --> 00:02:12.990
Make sure everyone at this table can hear the spoils.

00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:50.031
a potato?

00:02:59.026 --> 00:03:04.837
hahahah

00:03:18.836 --> 00:03:21.991
Who's we

00:03:28.438 --> 00:03:31.156
hahaha

00:03:32.573 --> 00:03:34.766
I don't do that, but I get what you're saying.

00:03:34.968 --> 00:03:39.627
So you're twitch streamer

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.127
I thought, no, when I downloaded it in 2020, I was like, wow, it's going to take so long for it to end.

00:03:53.127 --> 00:03:58.070
and it's already 2025 I'm like okay five years three more years to go

00:04:01.682 --> 00:04:06.407
I literally pre-installed it. Like, I looked at the place and went, wow, this game seems interesting.

00:04:06.407 --> 00:04:08.264
I just had to pre-install it.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.945
no i was bored it's going to the place where we're covid so i was like wow this game looks pretty

00:04:14.945 --> 00:04:18.085
pretty interesting i just downloaded it

00:04:19.856 --> 00:04:22.117
You are the beta

00:04:22.843 --> 00:04:27.838
And then 2021. 2021. Cause at least August 2020.

00:04:27.838 --> 00:04:27.922
you

00:04:56.475 --> 00:05:00.997
I think I had the problem where after the first outcome class

00:05:00.997 --> 00:05:04.946
I did that like when I first downloaded it and then I stopped playing the game.

00:05:04.946 --> 00:05:09.132
I didn't start playing the game again until like February when my sister pulled me back in.

00:05:09.132 --> 00:05:12.084
I thought he was like finish all the course

00:05:15.797 --> 00:05:18.125
When the game came out.

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:22.716
(****)

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:30.833
I saw that, but I'm still not playing the game.

00:05:30.833 --> 00:05:33.043
It also costs money

00:05:34.882 --> 00:05:38.088
But there's still no melody in the game

00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:43.016
But it costs money!

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.105
I totally think it's the same thing.

00:05:49.463 --> 00:05:54.238
I still have Genshin downloaded on my laptop and my PC at home, and I still update it.

00:05:54.238 --> 00:05:58.069
I just never unopen the game.

00:05:59.807 --> 00:06:03.485
I have an M2S steal at like 1 terabyte.

00:06:03.485 --> 00:06:08.480
And then I have a random Seagate hard drive I bought on Black Friday 2020 for like...

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.531
you

00:06:09.865 --> 00:06:14.555
$60 and then it has like six terabytes or no four

00:06:21.963 --> 00:06:26.435
My laptop, it came with like a 512M.2

00:06:26.436 --> 00:06:31.397
but then i also got an extra like one per my sd and then i just crammed it into the case

00:06:31.396 --> 00:06:32.949
and then it fit
