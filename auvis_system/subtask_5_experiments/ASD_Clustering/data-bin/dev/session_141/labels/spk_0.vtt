00:01:16.802 --> 00:01:20.126
They've still been publishing ones for mobile. Like they got a Mocha one.

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:24.952

00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:07.291
I think we just both missed, so we just suck at this.

00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:10.078
But eventually we got our shit together and got to the end.

00:02:11.477 --> 00:02:14.279
Yeah, I'm still figuring it out.

00:02:13.914 --> 00:02:15.698

00:02:52.753 --> 00:02:55.251
There's one that's an RPG and that's Infinity.

00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:58.861
Infinity is RPG one, right?

00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:02.389

00:04:59.248 --> 00:05:01.746

I feel like the PS2 and PS4 people actually like.

00:05:05.053 --> 00:05:08.327
But PS2 and PS5 are kind of like really bad games actually.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.426
No one actually wants to buy them. People get rid of them, no one actually wants to buy them.
