WEBVTT

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.810
Oh yeah not artistically mature but at the same time

00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:31.200
At the same time I feel like...

00:00:32.012 --> 00:00:35.623
I think he wants me to do a piece that has like more stuff.

00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:41.739
Like more like facets because like okay we heard elisa play the baby***

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.772
And it was kind of like, you know, it kind of just sounded like an A-tube.

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:48.871
like it, it just sounds like one whole phrase like more like one character

00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:51.384
you know, but obviously a character with

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:55.671
Different nuances, slight nuances that are a little bit harder to express.

00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:58.286
I feel like he wants me to play a piece

00:00:58.286 --> 00:01:01.148
that has like more contrasting characters

00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:04.514
Like, you know, you gotta work on, like, different characters than...

00:01:04.514 --> 00:01:07.027
Versus like, you know

00:01:07.027 --> 00:01:11.331
Harder to express one with like just nuances. Yeah

00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:15.363
I think that's what he meant based on like his

00:01:15.363 --> 00:01:19.347
Like you know support for me doing something because that was like

00:01:19.347 --> 00:01:23.092
Everywhere. Yeah, like wildly different.

00:01:23.092 --> 00:01:26.298
I think it makes sense, so, yeah

00:01:27.643 --> 00:01:30.991
Yeah. I was just like okay as long as I don't like

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:34.381
go to a e-quote-unquote easier piece, I'm happy,

00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:36.756
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:47.337 --> 00:01:48.410
yeah

00:01:58.125 --> 00:02:00.622
th I kind of want 

00:02:00.622 --> 00:02:02.933
I want to try less and more. 

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:09.726
Mm. My mom was used to, she's like Cuz like, you know cuz I brought it like a genius, right

00:02:09.648 --> 00:02:14.527
I was like, aren't you like curious about like what's a slick type of lesson with a genius?

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:19.422
Like yeah, but she didn't pay me so...huhu

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.265
The *** is that random? huh

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:41.882
It's gotta be a little bit, no? yeah

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.287
Yeah, yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's true.

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:54.792
I mean, I mean, isn't like Jamali the only one learning with those two?

00:02:54.792 --> 00:02:59.426
out of the freshmen? he's um Lindsey!

00:03:02.638 --> 00:03:05.205
They I think they usually pick up music 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.393
Cuz Johannes.

00:03:15.025 --> 00:03:17.183
I don't know. Actually don't know

00:03:26.448 --> 00:03:27.749
Yeah, I don't know

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.014
But I feel like they usually pick a music and then you pick one more. Yeah

00:03:56.354 --> 00:03:57.822
mmm.......

00:04:04.838 --> 00:04:06.190
mmm..

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.982
mmmm.....

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.327
mmm

00:04:27.857 --> 00:04:28.977

00:04:43.635 --> 00:04:45.373
mm........

00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:47.162
Unaccompanied

00:04:51.465 --> 00:04:54.995
I was working on one of the fugues.

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.895
 bum bum bum bum burarum

00:04:57.895 --> 00:05:02.400
I was working on that one before I came I never like

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.395
performed it. I swear I still have it under my fingernails.

00:05:08.091 --> 00:05:11.208
That was like, I think that was like the hardest thing I've ever played.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.907
That one really a hard. Like a chords

00:05:14.907 --> 00:05:19.565
It's so hard to like not get crunchy. Yeah, I played that one. So I think

00:05:19.488 --> 00:05:24.203
lowkey that one like finishing that one maybe going back to it

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.292
Ahhh, mm mm

00:05:55.803 --> 00:05:57.684
solo solo riff. 

00:06:02.982 --> 00:06:05.799
Call the Good night channel

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:10.306
That's like a true test of sound and everything.

00:06:15.914 --> 00:06:17.150
