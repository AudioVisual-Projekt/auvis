00:02:50.383 --> 00:02:51.853
I know

00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:55.403
I know like I'm looking at my like two years 

00:02:55.403 --> 00:02:59.808
Really my mom want this. And like I was feeling bad about myself, I was like

00:02:59.808 --> 00:03:04.111
My two years is like almost gone. It's like almost over.

00:03:04.111 --> 00:03:07.259
And like, we barely played anything. 

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:11.423

It took so long and it takes so long, you know

00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:37.608

00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:42.862
Though it's gonna cool, I'm starting to feel depressed.

00:03:47.108 --> 00:03:48.322

Last year, yeah, it's like Winter Quarters, like Depresso era.

00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:06.920
But then it's also like could I have done it faster? I don't know

Like could I have progressed faster?

00:04:11.525 --> 00:04:14.495
And, Yes, and no

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:18.180
I feel like

00:04:19.273 --> 00:04:21.061
The way I practice.

00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:27.417
is not like sufficient enough to my own standards.

00:04:28.548 --> 00:04:31.744
 And to what Jiyoung also expects.

00:04:32.883 --> 00:04:33.975

00:05:33.354 --> 00:05:38.951
75% of high school for me was spent on how to play chords.

00:05:38.876 --> 00:05:43.343
 so, I think I'm like pretty good with chords. Yeah

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:49.533
ohhh

00:05:50.061 --> 00:05:54.814
Yeah, no, all I do is court like bah like why most of them off on my butt 

00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:57.907
My my teacher pick was because I couldn't play like we 

00:05:57.907 --> 00:06:00.962
The Andante was because I couldn't play chords.
