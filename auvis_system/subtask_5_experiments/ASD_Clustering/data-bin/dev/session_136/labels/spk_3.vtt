00:00:07.538 --> 00:00:08.736
Prize, prize, prize.

00:00:15.318 --> 00:00:19.400
Solitaire..so you play

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.304
Wait, I'll go over my classes. Lang, I don't play anything.

00:00:22.304 --> 00:00:25.240
Physics? I play spider sometimes. Or I talk.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.974
(***) AI

00:00:27.974 --> 00:00:30.893
(***)

00:00:30.893 --> 00:00:35.887
and IT connections (***)

00:00:35.887 --> 00:00:40.747
Yeah (***)  I don't do any of the other ones. And then I play spider.

00:00:44.224 --> 00:00:46.975
No, not yet.

00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:51.665
I got bored of solitaire, that's why I stopped. I haven't got bored of spider yet.

00:00:51.665 --> 00:00:52.762
Yeah

00:00:54.636 --> 00:00:56.863
I have a switch.

00:00:59.546 --> 00:01:01.790
I have already requested that.

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:08.524
Why don't I play it? I don't know how to play it.

00:01:08.524 --> 00:01:10.700
I love my computer more

00:01:11.172 --> 00:01:12.387
Yeah

00:01:13.362 --> 00:01:14.688
Thanks!

00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:16.626
Ha!

00:01:19.527 --> 00:01:24.033
Thats (***)

00:01:24.053 --> 00:01:25.777
Ohw!

00:01:25.855 --> 00:01:30.411
I'm not going to say that. You literally told me to say, speak to Ms. Hernandez today.

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:35.361
Do you think I actually (***) 

00:01:37.887 --> 00:01:40.704
I'm not going to do that. I'm not insane.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.059
Yeah!

00:01:48.653 --> 00:01:52.162
What? No

00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:55.132
Why don't you go up to her? I'm still in her class.

00:01:55.132 --> 00:01:57.664
You're not in her car, she's not gonna do anything to you.

00:01:57.664 --> 00:02:00.685
She's gonna give you a referral to the counselors.

00:02:04.481 --> 00:02:07.248
Have you got a referral yet? You look like you have.

00:02:07.248 --> 00:02:09.813
I'm joking you don't have it

00:02:12.852 --> 00:02:16.733
You got a suspension?

00:02:18.082 --> 00:02:23.078
No. Me? A referral? For what?

00:02:23.078 --> 00:02:28.073
See, you don't know. You're just making things up.

00:02:28.073 --> 00:02:33.033
(***)

00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:35.915
Okay, so back to games.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:49.014
No..but I also enjoy it, like...

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.943
Its a...I feel like it's mainly to pass the time, but also...

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.915
If I didn't enjoy it, I might as well pay attention to class. So I didn't.

00:03:00.794 --> 00:03:02.269
Yeah!

00:03:04.692 --> 00:03:08.623
Wait, I pay attention in Lang? Physics?

00:03:11.272 --> 00:03:14.748
And Maths. That's three out of six of my classes.

00:03:15.543 --> 00:03:20.891
I don't find anything in life. I don't find anything in life. Cause Han, Han has goat guardians. She's scary.

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:25.853
You think you're so funny?

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.388
That's good

00:03:31.388 --> 00:03:34.813
Ha...Haaa

00:03:37.548 --> 00:03:42.256
Games? What games are you playing?

00:03:46.137 --> 00:03:47.705
Which one?

00:03:50.836 --> 00:03:52.140
What?

00:03:52.515 --> 00:03:53.527
No

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:00.164
No

00:04:00.943 --> 00:04:02.313
No

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.699
Like a really old one. I have an Xbox One maybe? 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.758
Like, I used to run in the Kibari.

00:04:15.805 --> 00:04:17.661
Hmm hmmm

00:04:20.815 --> 00:04:25.809
Pick me? You just called me a pick me?

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:28.914
Ha..Haaa

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:34.770
That's kind of a compliment. That's kind of a compliment, right?

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.748
 No, it wasn't (***)

00:04:40.441 --> 00:04:43.325
I don't think it's cute.

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:47.393
Actually like..It's like a waste of time 

00:04:47.393 --> 00:04:51.207
(***) It's like (***) but like..

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:54.936
In this day and age, I don't have the money for it.

00:04:54.936 --> 00:04:58.750
Think about eggs. You know how expensive eggs are.

00:05:06.866 --> 00:05:11.811
No..I have got...I use my hard-earned money for that

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:14.443
yeah for a game i might play for one week

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:21.835
But do you think I'd play it in the long term?

00:05:21.835 --> 00:05:25.412
I'm a busy woman. All right, you hate women.

00:05:34.609 --> 00:05:36.702
Yeah when I sleep

00:05:47.991 --> 00:05:52.750
Its like...I don't go to the hospital..come on

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.681
I'm not sick. I'm not sick.

00:05:56.615 --> 00:06:00.766
You think I am? I think you've been told.

00:06:03.191 --> 00:06:05.659
Me...No.
