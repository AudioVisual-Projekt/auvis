WEBVTT

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.522
Ha haaa....

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:06.220
Hmm hmmm

00:01:09.073 --> 00:01:13.326
So, there's, we have Kaishou, and then we have...

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.267
show up and then I say.

00:01:20.043 --> 00:01:24.970
(***) Haah! Queso?

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.350
It's queso?

00:01:27.757 --> 00:01:29.033
Yeah!

00:01:29.037 --> 00:01:32.125
Its quesco!

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:36.226
What? Really?

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.144
I thought it started with an R. Whoopsies. Umm

00:01:44.506 --> 00:01:45.849
Aaah?

00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:50.165
Oh yeah! right, well, I probably got something messed up. So.

00:01:51.228 --> 00:01:56.138
So, what do they mean? what do they mean? Hmm hmmm

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.424
Hmm hmmm

00:02:06.752 --> 00:02:11.460
Yeah! something like that. I only remember the righteousness part.

00:02:12.248 --> 00:02:14.189
What is Haisho?

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:15.923
Uhhh!

00:02:16.034 --> 00:02:21.029
I don't remember. Honestly I forgot everything about history.

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:23.544
Uh! ever since the mock.

00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:27.931
because I didn't study that much before it because I had 5 tests that was required

00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:32.925
And then I have tests a few days before during that week. And then I have a midterm.

00:02:32.925 --> 00:02:37.768
in like a few days. Yeah English

00:02:37.813 --> 00:02:40.969
Oh! where its class is so bad.

00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:45.919
No, it is kind of bad.

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.924
I do have friends in it.

00:02:49.514 --> 00:02:54.508
Yeah, it's fun, but she's a bad teacher.Haaa?

00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:57.124
Arranged seating? No.

00:02:57.124 --> 00:03:01.344
Yeah, we picked our own seats. We've been in those seats since the beginning of the school year.

00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:06.489
Ha ha haaa

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.409
Oh! they're always yapping.... in my class. There's only one.

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.189
There's like a bunch of smart kids, but the thing is they don't yap. They're like the...

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.290
They (***) They're like really silent, but they only yap

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.530
when like barrats like oh let's talk about this

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.534
I do! I have everything to say!

00:03:29.068 --> 00:03:31.566
Laurence? Is it Laurence?

00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:35.566
There's a bunch of them and I don't remember who they are. I don't think it's Lawrence though.

00:03:35.566 --> 00:03:37.595
But Lauren 

00:03:38.792 --> 00:03:39.911
Ohw!

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.706
Aaahhhmmm

00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:46.029
There is two kids in my math class, who talk about A-Push.

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:49.858
They're talking about how, they were talking about states versus uhm...

00:03:49.858 --> 00:03:53.757
federal rights, when...uh .. federal jurisdiction.

00:03:53.757 --> 00:03:56.542
when it comes to social security.

00:03:56.542 --> 00:03:59.578
Haaa...I know, right?

00:03:59.578 --> 00:04:04.573
Um, I don't know, because for VRAD we're talking about Social Security right now.

00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:13.753
I know, right? And they're having a whole giant debate about it.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:18.174
In math, like when we're putting away our Chromebooks, I can hear them still talking.

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:22.798
They're still debating. They've been debating it for like 5-10 minutes.

00:04:29.835 --> 00:04:33.024
Uhm., it was like the last 10 minutes of class.

00:04:33.024 --> 00:04:37.108
I don't think she minds. Also, she likes them. She likes these smart kids.

00:04:37.086 --> 00:04:41.153
Because she'd always go on long tangents when one of them would ask a 

00:04:41.175 --> 00:04:44.737
question and she spent like five minutes answering it.

00:04:44.737 --> 00:04:49.680
If it's about math, yeah. Because they're smart kids, right? They're all taking the AP course.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.685
They were taking uhm...AB

00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:55.586
BC and they'll talk, they'll ask questions

00:04:55.564 --> 00:04:59.513
about it...even though we're doing math analysis.

00:04:59.536 --> 00:05:03.872
So she'll talk about the AP class, she'll talk about the AP test itself

00:05:03.872 --> 00:05:07.214
when we're in pre-calc. 

00:05:07.214 --> 00:05:11.500
And it takes up about 10 to 15 minutes of our class sometimes.

00:05:15.066 --> 00:05:20.061
through the entire class. She like, because about like a fourth of them are taking the AP test.

00:05:20.038 --> 00:05:22.300
in our class I think.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.279
I know, right?

00:05:29.265 --> 00:05:31.056
Hmm?

00:05:32.944 --> 00:05:38.365
Ummm...I don't think they're taking AP. They're probably doing AB this year, so I'll study it.

00:05:38.365 --> 00:05:41.402
And then they're gonna do BC next year, probably.

00:05:41.402 --> 00:05:45.183
I know right? Big nerds.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:49.585
Haaa?

00:05:51.055 --> 00:05:55.139
Ummm....I don't know actually.

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.289
Honestly, they're they're nerds so maybe

00:06:12.317 --> 00:06:15.164
Wait, they do that? like?

00:06:16.258 --> 00:06:19.012
Ohw!

00:06:20.147 --> 00:06:23.219
Oh those weirdos.

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:34.086
Uhm..Honestly, I think Barrett's class is one of the worst classes we have, actually.

00:06:34.086 --> 00:06:38.997
Uhm...See thing is ...I didn't like Bender, but the thing is, Bender taught and I just didn't get a title.

00:06:38.997 --> 00:06:41.832
(***) So I

00:06:41.832 --> 00:06:45.392
I haven't paid attention in any of her lessons since the beginning of the year.

00:06:45.392 --> 00:06:49.240
First week I realized I can't pay attention, so I stopped.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.240
And I still, I have good grades in my classes.

00:06:53.675 --> 00:06:58.522
Uhmmm....So I finished off with like a 94 last semester.

00:06:58.522 --> 00:07:01.171
Like, zero paying attention in her class.
