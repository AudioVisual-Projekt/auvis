00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.324
Oh my gosh. Wait, what's your favourite nation?

00:01:04.324 --> 00:01:07.834
What's your favorite nation?

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:13.460
Oh my God! We see I... I ...did (***) others like one day left...on that one

00:01:19.072 --> 00:01:21.283
That's a good point

00:01:24.102 --> 00:01:27.240
They like stepped into the sun for like two seconds.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.965
Everyone else is a vampire...I mean...I am like...

00:01:31.965 --> 00:01:35.307
She has not communicated...(***)

00:01:35.307 --> 00:01:39.609
She's from the year. She had like the most melanin out of any gradual development

00:01:40.352 --> 00:01:45.346
You know what I mean? Like the rock star. The rock star. She's in all characters.

00:01:45.346 --> 00:01:49.718
Honestly, I don't know. I don't follow Genshin news anymore...like

00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:54.442
oh my gosh wait what the um like i love him so much

00:01:54.442 --> 00:01:57.632
Fontaine is actually one of my favorite nations because like after...

00:01:57.632 --> 00:02:02.323
They actually like upgraded...they upgraded their like cutscenes.

00:02:02.323 --> 00:02:04.989
Upgraded the cutscenes..and then because (***)

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:08.954
It's so vid and they're so long and so much clicking and clicking and clicking.

00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:11.924
But Fontaine, I genuinely enjoyed learning about it.

00:02:11.924 --> 00:02:15.519
Like, he was actually fine, because Sumire was just, like, so much for walking, too.

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.776
There's so much like unnecessary like...do..do...do...

00:02:26.098 --> 00:02:28.057
what?

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.373
For now first move?

00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:41.776
It's the desert. It's the desert.

00:02:41.776 --> 00:02:44.325
And all the puzzles you need so much

00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:47.228
the actual maximum completion like the R&R class. like..

00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:49.742
I'm not doing that. I have that

00:02:49.742 --> 00:02:53.354
a chunk of the VAP...like

00:02:58.973 --> 00:03:03.090
short side quest they said and then also the one in the museum

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.017
And this is on like one of the islands, so when I was a little boy.

00:03:08.017 --> 00:03:10.330
Suri, Suri..and like Suri

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.034
Yeah

00:03:13.231 --> 00:03:17.198
That one was like everyone was like, oh, it's so long, but it's so sad. It's so worth it guys

00:03:17.198 --> 00:03:19.729
I got halfway through it. It's like, I like it.

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:23.020
Because like...I...I hate the ones where I don't...

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.533
I am not...Like whenever I'm not like pampered like a little

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:30.528
toddler and given the lack of exact location of where I need to go, I get so lost.

00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:37.295
I think so...May be

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.364
They are nuts...ohhh!

00:03:46.341 --> 00:03:49.429
I will probably look don't use the word

00:04:07.164 --> 00:04:10.574
Does the mask do anything else or is it just for sentimental purposes?

00:04:10.668 --> 00:04:12.248
Ohhh!!!

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.255
I don't know. Its like..I think I'm going to like..uninstall again because it's a 100th cake.

00:04:17.255 --> 00:04:19.770
(***) I don't have that space on my laptop.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.740
So I have to uninstall it again. Oh, it's a gaming laptop.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.735
But like...It's like five years old. I think it's like time because I used to run Zoom, Genshin, and Roblox.

00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:28.646
at the same time.

00:04:29.338 --> 00:04:33.944
So I'm gonna probably uninstall it so I have more room for other games

00:04:33.944 --> 00:04:38.669
That's not Marvel Rivals because the only two games that I can afford to have installed right now

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.521
our Marlboro Rivals convention.

00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:46.314
No, I already understood (***) like oh I felt like a

00:04:46.314 --> 00:04:49.503
huge weight off my shoulders..I didn't

00:04:50.313 --> 00:04:55.308
I used to be...oh my god..I used to be, but I stopped crying and I just had it and stopped.

00:04:55.308 --> 00:04:58.295
With them

00:04:58.295 --> 00:05:01.383
At times...I just (***) I was like nervous

00:05:07.205 --> 00:05:11.542
I used to commit like hours and hours of (***)

00:05:11.542 --> 00:05:14.849
(***) whats on...

00:05:17.347 --> 00:05:22.241
No, there's quick plays, there's quick plays. It's cause you were playing in unrated, which is like the longer.

00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:27.102
It's just like...Its just basically a rigs game, but not rigs. It's just a long game.

00:05:27.996 --> 00:05:32.703
I know, you're still on level 3, I saw. You haven't logged in since we flashed.

00:05:43.284 --> 00:05:44.448
Did you what?

00:05:53.368 --> 00:05:54.948
Oh!!!

00:05:57.054 --> 00:06:01.712
I play. I play before I do my homework. It's so shameful. I'm so

00:06:01.712 --> 00:06:05.323
I'm so addicted. It's so bad.

00:06:08.378 --> 00:06:10.167
You are on twitter?

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:17.304
I love how everyone still calls it Twitter even though it's gone now. Twitter is so cute. And silly.

00:06:17.304 --> 00:06:22.046
No, no, no, Twitter is so like cute and silly and then X is just like...

00:06:22.046 --> 00:06:24.256
X

00:06:25.543 --> 00:06:27.281
champ?

00:06:34.458 --> 00:06:36.607
Elon?

00:06:37.318 --> 00:06:39.428
He's like, oh! Haa haa

00:06:40.737 --> 00:06:42.728
X

00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:47.426
Bro, that's dumb. I haven't seen it. You just sent it to me.

00:06:52.049 --> 00:06:56.116
I love how people hate on Elon Musk's own app. It's so easy.

00:07:00.049 --> 00:07:01.214
Are we?
