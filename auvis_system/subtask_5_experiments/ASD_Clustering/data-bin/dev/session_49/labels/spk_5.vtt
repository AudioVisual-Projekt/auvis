00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:58.363
Oh, your lab partner? Should I recap? Yeah, yeah, same thing.

00:00:58.686 --> 00:00:59.796
Mmm

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.569

Hopefully he teaches it again.

00:02:09.137 --> 00:02:13.627
That's like... I don't wanna... I don't know. Orgo is already hard by itself.

00:02:13.627 --> 00:02:14.672

Sarah said Drew isn't good, but I heard everybody else say that he is.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.241
Cyro said he was okay.

00:02:55.443 --> 00:03:00.033
Also his  i think extra credit they're not mandatory so I'll go for them

00:03:00.033 --> 00:03:00.539
Mike.

00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:03.444

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.361
(***) Oh, you have to go into class? like

00:03:14.106 --> 00:03:14.629
Why?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.629
So it makes you go in person, I guess. It will account for your attention.

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.535
You can only like

00:03:26.492 --> 00:03:28.484

Yeah, yeah, yeah, like the jail location.

00:03:31.993 --> 00:03:35.825
Wait, then why don't they just do the app? It's not like, oh, I'm not technologically advanced.

00:03:38.187 --> 00:03:42.456
I feel like in college everybody, maybe not everyone, but most people use this.

00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:46.287
Most people use iPads and stuff, so it's not like you can't... I mean, 

00:03:46.473 --> 00:03:50.996
yeah you can use your phone it's an app

00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:53.426

00:04:10.891 --> 00:04:12.527
(***)

00:04:28.644 --> 00:04:32.575
No, you have to get like the concept, like if there's something happening. 

00:04:32.887 --> 00:04:34.046
mmmmm

00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:40.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Is it like bond forming?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.650
how they form or why they form.

00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:50.951
He kind of touched on it. It's like the arrows and stuff, right? Not only that, but yeah. yeah yeah

00:04:52.897 --> 00:04:54.371
mmmm

00:04:55.103 --> 00:04:58.192

mmm

00:05:29.934 --> 00:05:34.372
(***) I think it's more like CS too. yeah

00:05:36.987 --> 00:05:41.745
Oh, so like hem, physics. how , why does she have a comp file?

00:05:44.935 --> 00:05:49.610
Okay. I mean, sure. I don't know. She doesn't have to be pre-med.

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:50.639
Anything?

00:05:54.504 --> 00:05:55.634

00:06:10.018 --> 00:06:13.613
I feel like a lot of them do. Like, neuroscience, I think you do.

00:06:13.538 --> 00:06:18.533
M.I.M.G. There's like, yeah. Like, they're just more complex.

00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:22.668
Okay. We just took like the simplest one. Yeah.

00:06:23.038 --> 00:06:27.528
Also, it's like... What is it?

00:06:28.995 --> 00:06:31.526
so ahhh

00:06:33.163 --> 00:06:35.627
