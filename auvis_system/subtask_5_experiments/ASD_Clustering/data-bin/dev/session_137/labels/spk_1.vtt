00:00:01.088 --> 00:00:05.729
You mean, yes, sir? ha ha ha ha ha.

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:08.192
Ha ha ha.

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:25.050
hmm morning worker.

00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:32.931
You all could like lowkey.  Nooo Because I've been...

00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:35.580
Too busy with trying to finish it.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.330
I only played the campaign

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.217
I can't even connect online.

00:00:42.992 --> 00:00:47.052
No I try connecting online all the time but there's something wrong with my Wi-Fi

00:00:47.022 --> 00:00:50.751
So I can't even play with other players if I wanted to. So I could only, huh?

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:53.788
I No, I have internet. I checked a hundred times.

00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.129
No, I don't think so.

00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:06.039
Yea they do.  Bro,  Activision the Activision games the developer.

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:12.672
And the thing is, you also need a PS4 account, but you also need a-

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:17.649
have another separate account based on the developer which really got me mad

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.691
I also have Assassin's Creed in my throat.

00:01:28.163 --> 00:01:31.301
(***) but but but but That's all I have.

00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:35.402
That's all I have. I'm not getting an actual computer.

00:01:35.622 --> 00:01:40.566
That doesn't work. I tried playing Fortnite on it, and it was so slow. It was so bad.

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:43.873
No I can't even run Minecraft properly.

00:01:48.414 --> 00:01:53.744
Hah ha ha ha ha ha.

00:02:00.074 --> 00:02:03.803
Guys like Even pocket edition. I struggle. I struggle like yeah

00:02:03.803 --> 00:02:07.768
actually playing Pocket Edition with YouTube right now.

00:02:10.544 --> 00:02:12.337
Yeah.

00:02:21.657 --> 00:02:26.583
Even when I'm by myself, I'm in my own individual world, it's like... ha ha ha.

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:29.099
hah ha hah ha. That's what I meant guys!

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.064
If it was multiplayer or on the servers, I wouldn't be complaining.

00:02:35.562 --> 00:02:38.446
He uhm oh its...

00:02:38.446 --> 00:02:41.485
My math homework is 10!

00:02:41.485 --> 00:02:46.480
Its really bad.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.011
No Wait (***)....

00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:54.005
Ha ha ha ha. That's why like I'm saying I can't play regular Minecraft

00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:55.102
Crap.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.202
I only like the show.

00:03:04.806 --> 00:03:07.201
We like our cane, yeah.

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:15.352
Oh yeah Oh yeah, I got the game. It's so good.

00:03:15.352 --> 00:03:19.082
can't it's so good guys i finished the game within two days.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.654
I never said I'm my favorite, I just have the games.

00:03:29.797 --> 00:03:31.671
I like it.

00:03:34.994 --> 00:03:37.964
Prize money is Good but like I'm not really that into it.

00:03:40.784 --> 00:03:43.078
Oh yeah, definitely.

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:51.195
Honestly, I don't know that much about the original one but...

00:03:51.363 --> 00:03:54.131
Um, I had the first...

00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:58.469
I have the remastered one right now, but I'm still figuring out how to play with it.

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:02.957
Oh my god, I don't know these years. I was trying to figure out the order these games come in.

00:04:02.957 --> 00:04:05.994
But then it was modern warfare. Modern warfare won.

00:04:05.994 --> 00:04:10.685
And then two and then three and then there's like another one two three and then this is the remaster.

00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:15.681
And there's Black Ops, and then I found out, oh, Cold War is a part of the Black Ops series and then..

00:04:15.681 --> 00:04:20.676
I'm like who's naming these and who's keeping track of these like this is awful.

00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:24.404
But i like it...

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:30.193
Oh yeah, I know. I was like, zombies? Why do they- Every game has a zombies.

00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:35.779
Oh actually no World War 2 is my favorite game. It's actually really good. I like World War 2.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:41.128
Talk about that. I play the campaign for a reason.

00:04:41.128 --> 00:04:45.702
But ha ha ha ha. Uhm World War two.

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:49.077
World War II Call of Duty is so good. So basically...

00:04:49.077 --> 00:04:52.282
It's on d-day i'm sure you know a lot about this.

00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:55.488
(***)

00:04:55.488 --> 00:05:00.214
So it's based on D-Day and you're an American soldier and which it's basically..

00:05:00.214 --> 00:05:03.640
Keep (***) progression until...

00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:09.241
It's so good, but it's so sad. My favorite character is Zussman. Yes, his name is Zussman.

00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:12.870
Ha ha ha ha. He's my favorite character but...

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.402
Is that a man? Is that a man?

00:05:15.402 --> 00:05:20.109
Yeah, that was my reaction to it like D.

00:05:20.109 --> 00:05:23.063
Cuz he's German Jew so it makes sense.

00:05:26.116 --> 00:05:28.615
Yea and there is So he's my favorite character.

00:05:28.615 --> 00:05:32.883
Oh my god he got into a concentration camp and i was so sad.

00:05:32.883 --> 00:05:36.192
But no he got out, he's alive.

00:05:39.296 --> 00:05:42.570
I actually think it's not that bad. They show the horrors of it.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.878
The opening was so good. It was so good ok and...

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:49.758
It's low-key they're not very on like oh it's like.

00:05:49.758 --> 00:05:54.164
Terrible terrible, but they're respectful enough that I think it's okay.

00:05:54.652 --> 00:05:57.149
Isn't no they're not being disrespectful or anything but....

00:05:57.149 --> 00:06:02.144
Characters is racist but the main character acknowledges this guy has enough racism for...

00:06:02.144 --> 00:06:06.599
So hes mad. Bigotry actually.

00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:18.294
I like Call of Duty World War 2 because the historic part is actually really interesting.
