WEBVTT

00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:20.952
soo okay wait what?

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:26.225
(****)

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:36.876
I love the costume.it was so cute

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.315
I do not like the new Snow White costumes.

00:00:44.638 --> 00:00:47.287
Why? Like, they could have...

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:50.292
(****) historical

00:00:50.393 --> 00:00:52.823
and they just chose not to.

00:00:56.062 --> 00:00:59.876
Like it's so lame and like she's just

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:02.966
it just looks so forgettable 

00:01:03.076 --> 00:01:06.147
Like it's just so underwhelming for Disney Princess.

00:01:24.632 --> 00:01:26.809
Working against yourself.

00:01:39.464 --> 00:01:42.181
But she has to be independent. She's a coward.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.484
yeah like uhhh

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:54.011
also do u like wanna be like really

00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:57.319
progressive, but then for the dwarves they use

00:01:57.318 --> 00:02:01.098
CGI dwarves instead of just actual people

00:02:01.098 --> 00:02:05.284
That's a really good opportunity.

00:02:05.284 --> 00:02:08.895
literally

00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:18.733
It's a good opportunity for them to expand their platform. You're literally supporting them.

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:26.074
Don't hit on the actors, though. Like, I respect them.

00:02:38.713 --> 00:02:41.785
Have you watched Percy Jackson?

00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:46.812
Like, I think they're kind of okay. Like, why are they so old?

00:02:50.812 --> 00:02:51.471
Yeah.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.025
He's gonna be like 30. yeah

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:05.746
Yeah, he's gonna be... He's so pretty.

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:09.071
hhahahah

00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:12.901
hahahahahah

00:03:21.187 --> 00:03:24.342
Let's talk about movies.

00:03:24.343 --> 00:03:29.321
oh how do u see? Oh my gosh, I'm so obsessed is like this

00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:33.523
its tiny (****)

00:03:33.523 --> 00:03:37.421
It's so cool. Yes, it's been out since February

00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:42.231
it came to theatres in america on  february 14th

00:03:42.636 --> 00:03:45.824
Like the little, the animated 3d animated

00:03:45.824 --> 00:03:50.702
Have you watched the second one?

00:03:50.702 --> 00:03:53.300
I can't find it online yet.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.296
But I hope it does come up for like, soon. Because it was so good.

00:04:03.037 --> 00:04:08.032
ohhhh but i was (****) first ones

00:04:08.032 --> 00:04:13.028
I like the first one. I also like the first and the third one. I'm not a big fan of

00:04:13.028 --> 00:04:16.942
second one because I feel like it's huge

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.169
sitting is a little jarring from like Chinese food

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.274
It's a little jarred.

00:04:26.274 --> 00:04:30.442
Yeah, I didn't like that so I like the first and third because 

00:04:30.443 --> 00:04:35.286
i love like I gotta kill this. I'm obsessed.

00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:41.546
I tried. I couldn't. I don't really like it.

00:04:41.546 --> 00:04:45.697
I try to watch it but again I'm not a very big fan

00:04:45.697 --> 00:04:49.495
, not stunned at all.

00:04:49.848 --> 00:04:53.628
I'm okay with water, but the Chinese animation style...

00:04:53.628 --> 00:04:58.252
thry have very weird swords

00:04:58.252 --> 00:05:02.843
they are not...

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.389
No, it's very specific but it doesn't fit.

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.781
like (***)  realistic stuff.its supposed to be

00:05:12.782 --> 00:05:16.208
Like it doesn't fit like realistic stuff

00:05:17.017 --> 00:05:19.514
Yeah, no lot of the...

00:05:19.514 --> 00:05:23.683
chinese stuff is very like too 2 dimensional like the main characters and stuff

00:05:36.913 --> 00:05:41.031
I have no idea. So cool. The Monkey King? 

00:05:44.995 --> 00:05:48.337
That sounds cute.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.843
I love it.

00:05:56.843 --> 00:05:59.221
I love fight scenes, though.

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:04.993
I'll take your word for it uhhhhh

00:06:06.985 --> 00:06:10.478
I've been really, really into...

00:06:11.355 --> 00:06:16.349
Oh, you know on Netflix? It used to be on Netflix.

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:16.485
Bye.
