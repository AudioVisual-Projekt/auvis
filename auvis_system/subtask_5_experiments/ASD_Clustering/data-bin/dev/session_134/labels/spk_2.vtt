WEBVTT

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.678
Huh?

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:25.875
Well, I started last time, it's your turn.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:30.127
What? No, I did. No, I did. No, I did.

00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:40.770
Favorite at least favorite robotics. 

00:00:40.743 --> 00:00:45.737
My favorite is just every time I'm up inhaling smoke or doing soldering stuff.

00:00:45.737 --> 00:00:50.260
or also every time or also uhh

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.112
Every time we've won an award because it's like...

00:00:53.112 --> 00:00:56.334
We're depressed and then we just win something all of a sudden?

00:00:56.334 --> 00:01:00.755
Least favorite is any other time this season.

00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:04.670
Any other time that I've had to do robotics this season?

00:01:04.724 --> 00:01:09.670
because it's like my stuff keeps getting lost like okay i'm doing a set

00:01:09.614 --> 00:01:14.611
The whole damn mechanism gets lost. Or, uh, batteries? Battery gets lost.

00:01:14.638 --> 00:01:18.754
or the battery charger got lost once.

00:01:19.588 --> 00:01:22.373
The $150 one I bought with all of its prices.

00:01:22.373 --> 00:01:27.048
I've been probably carrying like 90% of the battery charge the entire scene.

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.266
huh?

00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:35.951
I only go when I have to. If I'm not...

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:42.251
i wasnt...The ones that are required are the judging ones.

00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:45.171
So those are the only ones I usually go to.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:50.165
Sometimes I just go if I'm like being I need to do a set or something but like I

00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:53.474
I haven't gone to any like that in like a hot second.

00:02:02.316 --> 00:02:03.599
Can you say that again?

00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:15.715
ohhh Team 2 specifically?

00:02:15.715 --> 00:02:20.710
It was horrible with that. Like they would just leave their food around. Like...

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.117
Someone started using my water bottle as like a phone status 

00:02:24.117 --> 00:02:26.735
Bro, that's my water bottle. What are you doing with it?

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:32.556
huh? anik , goldmayor

00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:36.556
I don't understand why I feel like this.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.394
Oh yeah, and also Jen was on there unfortunately. Jen.

00:02:47.204 --> 00:02:49.717
Y'all put those built-in

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.312
I don't know why. I think they just won on top of Team 1.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.002
But like, why don't you do it in a nice way, so it makes her build head.

00:03:00.118 --> 00:03:03.038
like I don't know. Yeah.

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.498
Can you say that again?

00:03:13.831 --> 00:03:17.747
Why would I? I'm not doing it.

00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:22.289
I am done with robotics. After e3d.

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:25.306
Oh wait, no, it's not supposed to do stuff for FTC.

00:03:25.335 --> 00:03:28.540
I'll procrastinate on it though, until I start getting pined about it.

00:03:28.514 --> 00:03:32.748
If I'm not getting confronted then I won't do it.

00:03:35.687 --> 00:03:37.959
alright

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.092
Do you think you're gonna ever try and go back to robotics?

00:03:58.111 --> 00:04:02.871
So it's like number one abusive relationship.

00:04:02.871 --> 00:04:07.628
most toxic most abusive

00:04:50.088 --> 00:04:53.530
Neurons in secretary, right? Neurons in secretary, right?

00:04:57.264 --> 00:04:59.762
Oh, that's why they're pushing on you.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.312
Like, oh, they're busy with FTC, you are, so you can do everything. And then they're just bumming around.

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:07.697
Don't put them in those kind of positions then, right?like

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:32.375
The whole thing is a mess. I don't want to...

00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:37.370
I might just leave the server after I graduate because I don't know if I want to be in there and see the stuff they're having.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.687
Next year.

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:45.605
Hey, we'll just like mute that roll. I'll make roll pings and just, yeah, I don't know.

00:05:45.632 --> 00:05:47.742
The whole thing is just a mess.
