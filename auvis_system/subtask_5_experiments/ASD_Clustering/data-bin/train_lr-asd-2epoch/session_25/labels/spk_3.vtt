00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:45.957
And I think from there...

00:00:45.957 --> 00:00:49.112
Um I didn't why and 

00:00:49.112 --> 00:00:51.762

00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:52.754
but

00:00:53.146 --> 00:00:57.601
I found joy in doing that.

00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:01.905
work of the Lord and I felt like

00:01:01.905 --> 00:01:05.414

00:01:05.768 --> 00:01:10.763
In in into the path I need to be in. I felt like

00:01:13.714 --> 00:01:16.063
In And I understood that.

00:01:16.382 --> 00:01:20.888
But I feel like there was there was the still that electric

00:01:20.888 --> 00:01:26.151
Oh, Jesus. Yay. Moment was still... I thought I had it.

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:29.680
I thought I had it, but I realized that 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.624
haven't come yet.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.267
Um, it was where I found joy in doing the

00:01:40.228 --> 00:01:44.108
work of the Lord, Like so I started to get really involved with

00:01:44.614 --> 00:01:49.256
Um the youth program, and the, you know. um

00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:51.426

Ministry, the youth ministry I got so involved with.

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.908
And it was fun and I I enjoyed it.

00:01:58.908 --> 00:02:00.343
So I felt like...

00:02:00.713 --> 00:02:04.275
God was like, I felt God leading me.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.105
Um Back that

00:02:08.487 --> 00:02:10.428
Jesus moment.

00:02:10.484 --> 00:02:15.479
I I thought I had it already, but I didn't realize until...

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:19.175
Like this is like

00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:21.234
there's no like i i think

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:26.786
God knew that I hadn't reached that point of no return yet.

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:32.392
Yeah, and then but that point of no return like oh no, I'm I'm stuck

00:02:32.354 --> 00:02:36.050
I am like glued to him was um

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.171
when I hit 30 and then um

00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:43.872
i had all these plans at like in the 20s like oh have my bucket list of like

00:02:43.795 --> 00:02:48.829
things to accomplish before 30 and I always love doing that checkbox and

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.866
doing all the stuff.

00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:56.013
And then when I hit 30, I was so excited.

00:02:56.013 --> 00:03:00.790
Because my 20s was rough, like, you know, not landing, ah you know

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:04.822
A job identifier, yes, and then um

00:03:04.822 --> 00:03:08.543
You know working I worked so hard and I was so excited 

00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:11.572
And then now I have my credential I

00:03:11.926 --> 00:03:16.635
have my baby years of teaching down, like two years of teaching and I was like,

00:03:16.483 --> 00:03:21.342
I'm going somewhere and I was so excited to be 30.

00:03:21.342 --> 00:03:25.915
I was like looking so forward to my 30s and then in the first

00:03:25.915 --> 00:03:30.556
Six months, I lose my father, like, to cancer.

00:03:30.556 --> 00:03:34.657
And I was so angry. Like, I was so angry.

00:03:34.848 --> 00:03:39.365
But um this is where I realized, like I felt like...

00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:43.212
At church a lot of people are like, oh, you know

00:03:43.212 --> 00:03:45.727
You're so...um..

00:03:45.727 --> 00:03:48.984
It's so nice that you are a Christian family.

00:03:48.984 --> 00:03:51.954
Like, yeah, like, um...

00:03:52.848 --> 00:03:57.336
It's so like you guys are so different from other people when they lose their family.

00:03:57.336 --> 00:04:01.472
So I couldn't cry, like honestly.

00:04:01.472 --> 00:04:07.082
Yes, because it almost felt like, oh, like you believe in the promise.

00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:11.197
 You're in a safe spot. But I like, for me, I'm like, no, it's still her.

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.848
It's like that, I I miss my dad. I didn't want him to die.

00:04:15.848 --> 00:04:20.843
Even though I know that that promise was there, but I think so.

00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:24.540
Coming to terms with his death was like really hard for me.

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:27.053
And then one day I'm just like...

00:04:27.053 --> 00:04:30.965
And I was pretending. I feel like I was pretending to be this good Christian.

00:04:31.154 --> 00:04:35.002
Oh I you know, I'm so happy my dad is in a better place now.

00:04:35.002 --> 00:04:38.781
and I I'm holding on to this. let's I I think

00:04:38.781 --> 00:04:42.122
My Christianity was like a facade, to be honest.

00:04:42.122 --> 00:04:46.021
It was a big facade and I realized it was a facade.

00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:49.379
in a way, and then

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:53.312
In 2007, I just got so tired.

00:04:53.312 --> 00:04:55.826
of acting.

00:04:55.826 --> 00:04:59.319
like a Christian, like nothing hurt that I was so...

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:03.348
excited about the promise that Jesus had for us.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.747
Like I was tired of pretending.

00:05:05.747 --> 00:05:09.055
And that's when um I just left.

00:05:09.055 --> 00:05:11.603
and I went to Peru.

00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:14.546
And I traveled around Peru and then...

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:17.865
On the way home, I stopped by Costa Rica.

00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:20.463
ch And that's weird.

00:05:20.463 --> 00:05:26.031
Jesus came to look for me. I know he came to look for me.

00:05:25.954 --> 00:05:30.182
because I ended up in a private reserve in the middle of nowhere.

00:05:30.182 --> 00:05:32.697
huhuh I just like

00:05:32.697 --> 00:05:36.309
I don't know what what possessed me. I rented a car.

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:40.004
Ah we and a friend went with me. We rented a car.

00:05:40.004 --> 00:05:43.548
And we had to drive through.

00:05:43.548 --> 00:05:46.079
I don't know like

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:50.928
I have a GPS and we're going and midway through the GPS shuts off.

00:05:50.814 --> 00:05:53.538
and it says, like, Unchartered Territory.

00:05:53.538 --> 00:05:56.357
Right huhuh huh

00:05:56.357 --> 00:06:00.709
So the GPS stopped working and we're in the middle of like the tropical...

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.132
Yeah, like in the jungle. Like, get out of the way. What the heck?

00:06:05.132 --> 00:06:08.093
and my friends all passed out sleepy.

00:06:08.016 --> 00:06:12.995
Because she's like, I'm so, I'm I'm car sick. So here I'm like, I felt so...
