00:00:19.863 --> 00:00:24.504

00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:26.574

00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:34.876
Who's the loser?

00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:40.563
Sound off from the TV series anyway, so.

00:00:40.563 --> 00:00:45.136
The ring goes forward, the key comes out.  amm...

00:00:45.203 --> 00:00:47.059
Other than that...

00:00:47.093 --> 00:00:48.778

00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:52.275

00:01:17.013 --> 00:01:18.499
Yeah...

00:01:19.848 --> 00:01:24.658
Super old too, right? Just like Galangal.

00:01:24.658 --> 00:01:29.602
Like  Galangalio. so  Galanjio  is a lot older

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:33.364
Then  woodland king? 

00:01:33.923 --> 00:01:34.901

00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:40.624
Ah  huh...

The other character I like is...

00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:06.879
The... Um..

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.596

Brad is gas. The only thing that he never really come back.

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:16.093
after the second movie.

00:02:18.844 --> 00:02:21.932
Did he come out on the third part?

00:02:26.774 --> 00:02:31.060
oh yeah yeah yeah that's right that's right that's the part

00:02:32.512 --> 00:02:36.765

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.028

00:03:00.608 --> 00:03:02.482
Yeah.

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:07.173
One of my memorable moments of that location is the bees.

00:03:07.173 --> 00:03:11.038
The bees, they are so big

00:03:15.088 --> 00:03:17.416
humongous bees

00:03:18.075 --> 00:03:23.070
What about the story that he said that he's the last one of his kind?

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.237
Yeah..That's not from the book.. that...

00:03:31.827 --> 00:03:34.207
Okay..  okay...

00:03:35.254 --> 00:03:39.962
The last one, which kind of makes the whole thing more dramatic.

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:44.974
Yeah...   yeah...

00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:49.090
Yeah...   So...

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.988

00:03:52.988 --> 00:03:57.866
I hate..  I don't like doors but I hate...

00:03:57.866 --> 00:04:02.861
More. Yeah..  yeah... I like that one.

00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:07.838
So  why you need..? You know...  (***)He was willing to help.

00:04:07.838 --> 00:04:12.075
but he's kind of the character that who can who can think

00:04:12.224 --> 00:04:14.153
He... he...

00:04:14.336 --> 00:04:18.707
He's able to distinguish the level of...     he able to Nike..

00:04:18.707 --> 00:04:23.364
dislike and then he choose he's able to choose

00:04:23.364 --> 00:04:28.055
Less dislike to dismore dislike.

00:04:28.055 --> 00:04:30.924
You know what I mean? so.. yeah..

00:04:33.705 --> 00:04:35.659
Ahh... huh...

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.348
Oh, God.

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:45.319
Did he say something that the young duck wanted?

00:04:48.864 --> 00:04:50.539
Ohhhh...

00:04:56.811 --> 00:05:01.028
Oh, the dead walking? Not dead walking?  What is...

00:05:02.768 --> 00:05:07.677

00:05:07.677 --> 00:05:09.095
Okay.

00:05:14.732 --> 00:05:19.119
Ohhhh..... So that's why he went into the tomb to look for the proof.

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:24.114
Which he find it because the tomb was broken and he wasn't there

00:05:24.114 --> 00:05:27.996

00:05:29.987 --> 00:05:34.982
Oh, okay. So it's not like one only been locked up in that.
