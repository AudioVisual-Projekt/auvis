00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:18.585
I do not. I work at the school.

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:23.698
I work with my elementary school kids and years ago I used to teach.

00:00:23.698 --> 00:00:27.631
So by then, now, I stayed at home for a while, and I went back to school.

00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:31.326
And what I started doing was called instructional assistant.

00:00:31.326 --> 00:00:34.852
So basically assist special ed students.

00:00:34.852 --> 00:00:39.257
in the classroom and support them throughout the day. So that's what I do.

00:00:40.503 --> 00:00:45.281
I have to say...My..The students I work with are all autistic.

00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:48.638
And a lot of them are nonverbal, so they use a...

00:00:48.638 --> 00:00:52.620
It's really interesting to have this iPad. It's called Proloquo Program.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.254
And it's literally icons. And you press the icon.

00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:59.287
And then it talks for you, so you press the look button.

00:00:59.287 --> 00:01:04.231
And it actually tells back to you... look. So someone else can hear what you're trying to say.

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:07.576
So they use that as part of it. Except that some of them have a very

00:01:07.504 --> 00:01:11.960
Like they have lots of icons. I gotta swipe that to see which one they're looking for.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.436
But it's really interesting. They really get to know us. Some of the kids are really good at that.

00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:18.002
and the others are just gonna just trying to learn.

00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:21.462
So we try to adjust for them, like one couldn't do any I amm...

00:01:21.462 --> 00:01:25.343
The iPad thing is kind of hard for them, so we just use Velcro.

00:01:25.343 --> 00:01:27.856
and just kind of tear off the icon.

00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:30.895
Here you go, just give it to me and yeah, so.

00:01:30.895 --> 00:01:34.403
That's what I've been doing for a while. So it's been about my eighth year now.

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:36.411
Yeah!

00:01:37.742 --> 00:01:38.887
hh..haaa...

00:01:40.722 --> 00:01:45.002
Ahhh...So mine's, yeah, from kindergarten all the way through fifth grade.

00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:47.752
So I work with all of them because I actually go and teach in the classrooms.

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:51.567
Hh hmm. Yeah.

00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:55.886
They are, the way they do in our elementary school is two grades.

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:58.704
per year. So like what they do is kindergarten versus...

00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:04.037
and then second and third in another classroom, then fourth and fifth in a different classroom.

00:02:04.037 --> 00:02:09.031
Yeah, so it's been interesting. Hh..hhhh

00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:09.335
Yeah.

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.372
Oh, did you?

00:02:23.813 --> 00:02:25.300
Yes, okay.

00:02:26.985 --> 00:02:27.796
Hm hmm

00:02:31.914 --> 00:02:35.659
Yes, yes. Ah haan.

00:02:40.762 --> 00:02:42.456
Hm hmm

00:02:52.247 --> 00:02:54.747
Interesting you said that, when I was in General Ed

00:02:54.747 --> 00:02:58.426
I also had the gay kids in my classroom and we had an autistic child in there.

00:02:58.426 --> 00:03:01.177
They were so protective of her, very protective.

00:03:01.153 --> 00:03:04.533
You're right. There was another child who was more verbal.

00:03:04.533 --> 00:03:09.527
but he also had elements of autistic spectrum and they're also very protected by him too.

00:03:09.527 --> 00:03:14.438
They knew, so whenever he was able to be encouraged or just excited, he could write pretty well.

00:03:14.438 --> 00:03:18.253
And one time he just wrote this beautiful essay. The teacher read it in class.

00:03:18.253 --> 00:03:23.247
And we all clapped. All the kids clapped for him. Just spontaneously. It was the cutest thing.

00:03:23.247 --> 00:03:27.247
Yeah...yeah, they're very supportive.

00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:40.342
And they call it mainstreaming. Yeah.

00:03:40.342 --> 00:03:45.336
So that if you're able to...ammm... have modified work.

00:03:45.336 --> 00:03:49.287
In the regular classroom, are you able to....ahhh

00:03:51.092 --> 00:03:53.590
go along with the program that they have, but it will be modified work.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.585
Yes, they'll have it. So then when I first started, it was with one student in the mainstream classroom.

00:03:58.585 --> 00:04:02.584
and so I just kind of supported him and adopted his work for him.

00:04:02.584 --> 00:04:05.098
and then...so he's able to. But he

00:04:05.098 --> 00:04:10.092
had a lot of issues with just not being able to meet people socially and also he did...ammm.

00:04:10.092 --> 00:04:14.549
when his motions were kind of up and down he didn't know how to handle that so we had to kind of

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.664
So that's when he could be a little more aggressive. So we had to kind of find a way in.

00:04:18.664 --> 00:04:23.307
look for triggers and then find ways to support them that way.

00:04:23.307 --> 00:04:24.252
Yeah.

00:04:27.728 --> 00:04:30.326
Yes, so each one does have their own. Hhhh

00:04:30.326 --> 00:04:34.326
So you got to learn each one of those triggers and it helps to know the child.

00:04:34.685 --> 00:04:35.687
Yeah!

00:04:35.963 --> 00:04:38.461
So have different kinds of jobs. Hhhhh....

00:04:38.461 --> 00:04:42.223
Yeah...., very supportive.

00:04:42.223 --> 00:04:47.033
Did you feel like you were able to, is this what you were looking for?

00:04:47.033 --> 00:04:50.071
Or did you happen to? I was'nt sure.

00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:53.209
The job that she wanted to have.

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:57.293
Yes, what you... how did you end up here if you were teaching before?

00:05:00.804 --> 00:05:01.615
mchhh...

00:05:07.298 --> 00:05:08.754
Aahow...

00:05:17.155 --> 00:05:19.973
Yes, middle school is hard.
