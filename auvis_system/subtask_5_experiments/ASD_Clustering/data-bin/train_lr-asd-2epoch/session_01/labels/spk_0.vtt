00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.438
Hehehe. So. i was recued about the attorney.

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:22.756
Do. Because they can't work remote because everything is like WebEx now?

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:24.505
Can you have an attorney from like L.A.

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:30.927
Do a case in Boston. And do they get paid the same? or.

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:16.008
 I could, could, I'm wondering if they have to have like a bar to practice.

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:19.883
They can only practice a certain state.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.505
Right.

00:02:24.065 --> 00:02:26.670
That's so interesting.

00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:38.264
Yes, yes, yes.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.455
Uhuh. So we obviously it's immigration court

00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:44.605
So we'll, we'll  go like some more of,

00:02:43.622 --> 00:02:48.162
our doctor and our therapist will go testify.

00:02:48.162 --> 00:02:51.683
Um. For the cases if you know the

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:55.674
they require to back up their report that they wrote for the client but like

00:02:55.097 --> 00:03:01.310
Uh. The case managers will just go as a support because we don't testify, so, we can be the  

00:03:00.092 --> 00:03:05.037
There's as an emotional support, like just sit in the background and do nothing.

00:03:08.255 --> 00:03:14.448
It's  immigration court, so they have, they have one and.

00:03:13.444 --> 00:03:16.222
In Santa Ana for the Orange County.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.358
They have one in Van Nuys for like the valley.

00:03:19.077 --> 00:03:23.332
Then, they have one in downtown, like the Los Angeles court.

00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:26.663
It's kind of by a little Tokyo and, and, Plaza Olvera.

00:03:26.215 --> 00:03:31.342
And then they have the one of the LAX. That one used to be on Olive Street.

00:03:30.872 --> 00:03:34.177
 And, they move it to like a... close,

00:03:33.643 --> 00:03:36.925
to LAX. It's not in LAX. It's like

00:03:37.096 --> 00:03:38.490
 Yeah.

00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:45.013
Yeah...

00:03:45.013 --> 00:03:50.564
So, so, those, those judges will strictly do immigration court.

00:03:50.008 --> 00:03:53.164
like cases because you guys know the backlogs like

00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:59.323
Hehehe. And LA has such a high number of cases.  

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.293
Taking the thousands. Hehe.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.378
Yeah. Like. They're waiting for their court case.

00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:12.875
So they'll be on our caseload for like 10 years.

00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:17.870
until there's some kind of and even after they like if they get asylum or they say they didn't

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.865
We'll still keep them on as long as we can to help support them through the next stages.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:27.860
But, but, because our therapist and our doctor

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.846
are so good, we have a high

00:04:30.846 --> 00:04:36.182
We have a high rate of asylum that's granted as opposed to them off,

00:04:35.435 --> 00:04:40.836
Yeah. Because they do such a good job.

00:04:59.618 --> 00:05:04.326
We could tell if they have a strong case in mind and they're like really likely to.

00:05:04.326 --> 00:05:08.291
Um. For example...

00:05:07.651 --> 00:05:14.632
because like oh i don't know now because, they're, they're changing all this stuff right but before
