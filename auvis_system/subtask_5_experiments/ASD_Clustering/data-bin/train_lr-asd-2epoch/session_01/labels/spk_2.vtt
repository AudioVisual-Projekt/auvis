WEBVTT

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.954
Okey

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:22.484
Yes.

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:28.618
Yes.

00:00:29.505 --> 00:00:34.179
Um. We have had attorneys that moved to different states.

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:38.833
And like, for instance, if an LRB attorney moved out.

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:40.253
to Texas.

00:00:40.253 --> 00:00:44.978
Um. They still wanted to keep their LA salary, right?

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:49.187
And to a certain extent, it depends.  

00:00:48.608 --> 00:00:52.489
It's case by case. We have to honor certain things. The contract is a contract.

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.484
And we would do that, but... Um

00:00:57.484 --> 00:01:03.118
It, it just some. You know maybe next year, their rate mght

00:01:02.977 --> 00:01:06.794
get adjusted a little bit, or you know, certain things, like certain factors.

00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:09.953
are kind of factored into that, Um, to change.

00:01:10.874 --> 00:01:12.024
Just the rate.

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:20.417
They do that. That is true, yes.

00:01:20.417 --> 00:01:24.450
Once you do have to get be admitted to the state bar.

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:28.238
that you are working out of so it is essential for you to

00:01:27.724 --> 00:01:32.456
If you're in LA, you have to pass the California State Bar to practice, right?

00:01:32.713 --> 00:01:34.828
Um, but there are.

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:39.367
There's a court. Ohhh... I forget the name exactly.

00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:44.243
There is a petition you can do. So let's say there's a case in Washington DC.

00:01:44.243 --> 00:01:49.849
That's  some of our California attorneys need to practice them, but they're not all admitted.

00:01:49.206 --> 00:01:52.799
in DC. So you have an attorney there and you can have.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.795
Another attorney who resides in Washington D.C. is practicing there.

00:01:57.795 --> 00:02:01.490
And they will. Um.  It's like a.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.659
Not a substitution of attorney, but they actually can.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.040
um, petition you as like a friend of the court.

00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:12.847
And so for this case, because you have a certain level of expertise,

00:02:12.847 --> 00:02:18.279
that is needed in this case. Let's say it expands the two, you know.

00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:22.230
States or whatever it is and for that case only you can't be admitted.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.718
to be able to practice, you know, to represent in that.

00:02:27.225 --> 00:02:31.048
But it is a case by case. And.

00:02:35.046 --> 00:02:38.767
All the time, a lot.

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:09.826
Isn't that like the superior courts or are you going to different?

00:03:09.891 --> 00:03:11.590
Portraits?

00:03:15.494 --> 00:03:17.258
Uhuh.

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:28.200
Uhm hum

00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:37.407
Oh, okay.

00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:44.529
Oh, okay that sinks small.

00:03:55.313 --> 00:03:56.856
 yES.

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:01.714
Yeah....

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.578
So you have clients that you've been...

00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:08.492
Representing for years. In our

00:04:22.898 --> 00:04:25.429
Right.

00:04:36.858 --> 00:04:41.380
Wow, that's amazing, yeah.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.634
Yeah, I'm sure those cases are not.

00:04:44.841 --> 00:04:48.733
I see and I wonder if it's are you able to

00:04:48.283 --> 00:04:52.317
tell like with your level of experience just like

00:04:51.995 --> 00:04:56.736
If you can see whether an asylum case might be granted or not.

00:04:56.736 --> 00:05:00.433
Not that you, you know, I know it's always up to the judge. But.
