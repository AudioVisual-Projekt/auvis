00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:16.293
ha ha When I was

00:00:16.674 --> 00:00:17.637
ah

00:00:18.488 --> 00:00:21.475
in university time, went to Europe.

00:00:21.475 --> 00:00:25.525
by myself. Actually it was for the class. I was to meet

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:28.563
our class in the hotel.

00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:31.650
on a certain day by certain time.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.577
So went there by myself from London to, well, London, I went with my friends.

00:00:36.577 --> 00:00:40.206
But from London to Greece, I went by myself.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:44.795
I arrived at the middle of the night and

00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:49.875
I had to go to the hostel, youth hostel that I was going to stay.

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:54.685
but I didn't know how to get there and at that time of course there's no cell phone.

00:00:54.685 --> 00:00:57.975
So I called using the payphone.

00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:01.469
and and got the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.826
And they said, well, just come and gave me (***)

00:01:04.826 --> 00:01:08.658
bus route so I took the bus to the city

00:01:08.658 --> 00:01:11.171
And then from the city to the...

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:14.817
the youth hostel, but by the time I got to the middle of the city,

00:01:14.817 --> 00:01:19.052
It was all like, all the stores are closed. It was like almost midnight.

00:01:19.052 --> 00:01:23.692
So nobody was there and then I didn't even know if the bus was still running.

00:01:23.692 --> 00:01:26.579
So what do I do?

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:28.284
and so

00:01:28.435 --> 00:01:33.142
I found a couple that was walking, so I grabbed them and said,

00:01:33.142 --> 00:01:36.264
You know, I need to go there and I showed them the book.

00:01:36.264 --> 00:01:41.260
And I need to go here, I need to go here. And I didn't speak, of course, Greek or anything.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.254
speaking (***) the come us like (***) something like that and then

00:01:46.254 --> 00:01:48.769
Yes, japanese 

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:52.008
Oh! We speak Japanese!(***)

00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:54.945
So they spoke Japanese.

00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:59.941
i actually they they gave me the token to get on the bus and got the

00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:02.977
So that was like 

00:02:02.977 --> 00:02:05.492
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:09.002
Yeah, I don't know if it was still running or...

00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:11.652
I think those two were the angels.

00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:15.448
and then the bus I took was actually the chariot of the one.

00:02:15.618 --> 00:02:17.148
ha ha ha ha

00:02:17.643 --> 00:02:21.573
That trip was wow because that was the very first trip I took.

00:02:21.573 --> 00:02:24.612
all by myself and it was you know across the

00:02:24.612 --> 00:02:28.713
I mean, they're different countries across the world.

00:02:28.713 --> 00:02:32.712
on the other side of the world, so that was nice to know.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.555
mm

00:03:00.836 --> 00:03:02.119
yeah

00:03:02.986 --> 00:03:07.677
But where would you want to go? Not by yourself, but to explore.

00:03:10.697 --> 00:03:11.896
wine.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.595
Did I tell you I actually visited those places, the hills where it

00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:22.543
(***) i have been there. i have been there

00:03:22.543 --> 00:03:25.666
But the weight to the...

00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:29.682
the field where they filmed it there was a flintstone house

00:03:30.615 --> 00:03:33.478
uh ha ha ha

00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:36.347
So that was fun.

00:03:36.347 --> 00:03:40.970
Flintstone is a cartoon.

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:46.590
I don't think so. I don't.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.915
Well, maybe. I don't know why it was there.

00:03:49.915 --> 00:03:53.779
oh well maybe we should google that

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.655
Hobbits 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:07.144
uhh really

00:04:08.646 --> 00:04:09.625
oh Like that.

00:04:11.733 --> 00:04:16.340
Just just  one? ha ha ha  Just one?

00:04:20.813 --> 00:04:21.691

yeah Just a tour. yeah  yeah

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.513
It would be smaller than us, right? Because Hobbit is small.

00:04:42.513 --> 00:04:43.831
How tall?

00:04:43.868 --> 00:04:44.806

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:51.063
oh its like this ohh

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:55.761
So Gandalf is not tall. He's not a giant.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.675
So from the Hobbit.

00:05:06.967 --> 00:05:10.028

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:16.915
