huha

00:00:14.242 --> 00:00:18.073
So you were praying about your dream and seeking God.

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:28.699
mhmm

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.268
right

00:00:37.327 --> 00:00:42.287
Was there also this sense of urgency, like I need to do it quick, I need to get out of where I'm at?

00:00:42.287 --> 00:00:44.464
Is it more like I'm going to take my time.

00:00:45.786 --> 00:00:46.860

Okay.

00:01:12.536 --> 00:01:13.609

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:20.797
I have a quick question though.Who is this?

00:01:20.797 --> 00:01:24.509
Was this your first trip to Japan that was like for business?

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.222
where it wasn't like a vacation? okay

00:01:33.036 --> 00:01:33.995
right

00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:38.027
Oh OKay

00:03:48.184 --> 00:03:49.488
mm..

00:04:00.315 --> 00:04:04.282
That's kind of off-putting to know that that was the attitude instead of like...

00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:09.057
taking the opportunity to react. It's just like, wow.

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:20.877
yeah

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.926
So I'm just trying to get it off.
