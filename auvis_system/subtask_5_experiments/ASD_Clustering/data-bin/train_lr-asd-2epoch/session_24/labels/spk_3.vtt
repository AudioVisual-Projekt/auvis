00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:13.845
All right ahh

00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:20.697
Yeah, I I The thing is, I think I was just talking.

00:00:20.697 --> 00:00:24.139
And I think those were my prayers. I was just

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:29.084
Talking into this thing, like what do I do? Like asking questions.

00:00:29.084 --> 00:00:32.940
And I didn't realize, it wasn't like, okay, sit down, dear God.

00:00:32.863 --> 00:00:37.858
Like, it was just like, what am I doing with it? Like, Jesus.

00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:43.446
Noo

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:48.321
I'm gonna take my time. Like, please show me.

00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:52.224
What am I supposed to do? And from there, I think...

00:00:52.224 --> 00:00:54.395
It just gradually...

00:00:54.797 --> 00:00:55.795
um

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:59.830
Like Little by little, I think God gave me sight.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.768
and one of them was...um

00:01:01.768 --> 00:01:04.858
This time you need to plan like a business trip.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:09.550
And then I was required to go in um

00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:12.553
Observe this refractory.

00:01:14.022 --> 00:01:18.460
And then um and then at this factory I had to like...

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.526
 Make sure, yes.

00:01:24.704 --> 00:01:29.344
That was my first international business trip. I had other business trip

00:01:29.344 --> 00:01:33.496
in United States. I've I've been flying around all over the United States.

00:01:33.496 --> 00:01:37.528
Because we had to pick up all these startup companies.

00:01:37.528 --> 00:01:42.002
and see if these startup companies can meet the demands of whatever 

00:01:41.964 --> 00:01:46.269
customers needed and one of them was like I had to go to the factory.

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:51.281
to see if they can meet the demands of what the customer in the U.S. needed.

00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:55.838
And I was, asked to go there because of my translation skills.

00:01:55.838 --> 00:01:59.433
So the customer requested me to go with her.

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:04.619
Yeah, so and then I would do the translation and then we'll walk through the factory to see if

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.882
Um They could meet the demands and then when I was there

00:02:09.725 --> 00:02:14.265
I ran into like a kid that's like literally

00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:16.779
High school age, I think.

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:21.269
think extremely like he he was like right out of middle school.

00:02:21.844 --> 00:02:24.795
He asked what are you doing?like

00:02:24.795 --> 00:02:29.790
What are you doing here? And and for him it was work.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:31.989
and he and

00:02:31.883 --> 00:02:36.389
He acted to make a living. And then I started to ask a question like...

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.527
Would he have been there if he had a choice?

00:02:39.527 --> 00:02:44.522
had a little hack like if you love it and you're there, that's one thing.

00:02:44.522 --> 00:02:49.517
But if you're there because you have no other choice, so I think that

00:02:49.517 --> 00:02:54.057
God planted that in my mind. And then

00:02:54.057 --> 00:02:58.174
Um I I came back and that always stuck with me.

00:02:58.174 --> 00:03:02.628
And then ah right after that was the Columbine High School shooting.

00:03:04.048 --> 00:03:06.848
And I was just completely shocked.

00:03:06.848 --> 00:03:10.796
I was like oh my gosh, I couldn't find any words.

00:03:10.796 --> 00:03:14.188
And then I remember that day going into the office.

00:03:14.188 --> 00:03:19.320
and you know how they were complaining like oh it's the video games that

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:23.688
these kids replied and then I just at the lunch room I just

00:03:23.688 --> 00:03:26.508
and while everybody was watching the news.

00:03:26.508 --> 00:03:30.574
I was like, so how much responsibility do we... What role do we 

00:03:30.574 --> 00:03:34.910
Play in in all of this. And everybody just turned around.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.834
And what are you talking about?

00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:42.588
We supply these chips.

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:45.610
Huhhu in the video game machine.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.513
So what role do I play?

00:03:48.513 --> 00:03:52.123
on the death of these teenagers.

00:03:52.747 --> 00:03:56.883
An youngster, Everybody just laughed at me. Oh how nice.

00:03:56.883 --> 00:03:59.868
How naive, we know? this is the 

00:04:06.033 --> 00:04:09.168
mhmm, about monster

00:04:09.168 --> 00:04:12.839
Everybody was like, oh, oh, you're so innocent and

00:04:12.763 --> 00:04:15.783
 naive, that's just not the way the world works.

00:04:15.783 --> 00:04:20.777
And that's when I said, I really can't stay in this business. Like, it's just not me.

00:04:20.777 --> 00:04:23.849
And then I remember this hit.

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:28.844
It was and I and that was the realization, I can't change the world.

00:04:29.457 --> 00:04:31.426
It's already on the site

00:04:32.615 --> 00:04:36.421
Has like, is on this path and I cannot

00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:39.914
Only God can change it, but...

00:04:39.914 --> 00:04:44.065
I told myself that I can, what I can do.

00:04:44.065 --> 00:04:47.642
has changed the world for the kids.

00:04:47.642 --> 00:04:52.368
Right, and I decided like, oh my gosh, I want to work with kids.

00:04:52.368 --> 00:04:54.521
It's like teenagers.

00:04:55.556 --> 00:04:59.438
And I want them when they walk out.

00:04:59.438 --> 00:05:03.358
that the the world is not going to change more than 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.036
but they can have

00:05:07.012 --> 00:05:11.621
the option, they can change their path.

00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:15.013
into the world that they want to walk into.

00:05:15.013 --> 00:05:19.351
And that's when I'm like, I want to be a teacher. And that was just a realization.

00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:24.345
That's what I want to do. And so I called up my dad and I'm like, I'm coming home next week.

00:05:24.345 --> 00:05:28.851
Huhhahhhaa I'm gonna be a teacher and my dad's like okay

00:05:28.851 --> 00:05:30.049
So um

00:05:32.378 --> 00:05:35.669
I quit and I I had not used online.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:40.664
days and stuff so I left a month earlier and I already um

00:05:40.664 --> 00:05:40.698

Um I'm gonna do temp jobs near my house.

00:05:57.183 --> 00:06:00.845

00:06:00.845 --> 00:06:05.251
Um rent and everything, so my dad's like, okay.

00:06:05.251 --> 00:06:08.001
