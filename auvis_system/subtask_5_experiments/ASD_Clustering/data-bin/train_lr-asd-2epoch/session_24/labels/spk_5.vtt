00:00:13.474 --> 00:00:15.732
Ahhhuh

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:20.296
Oh well creative hobbies that I would get into.

00:00:20.296 --> 00:00:23.096
I wanted to get into painting.

00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:25.611
My mom actually might have.

00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:28.886
In high school, my sister um was...

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:32.159
a really good art. um She painted.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.774
And ah she had a

00:00:34.774 --> 00:00:37.288
wait our teacher who loved her 

00:00:37.174 --> 00:00:42.267
Pieces, I thought she was the best thing ever. And so when I entered school...

00:00:42.267 --> 00:00:46.452
high school and I wanted to take an art class. She was the only art teacher.

00:00:46.452 --> 00:00:51.041
And when I went in her class, and I was drawing, and when she...

00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:55.211
I found out that my sister was... I thought I was her sister.

00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:57.724
Huh She just dropped everything.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:01.977
and and you know went to the whole class and tell them how wonderful my sister was.

00:01:01.977 --> 00:01:05.722
What a great artist she was. And I thought, yes!

00:01:06.297 --> 00:01:09.892
And That turned me off. she huha That turned me off because...

00:01:09.892 --> 00:01:13.655
Um In high school she was go only if you wanted to

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:16.169
progress in art, she was your ally.

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:18.768
And I don't want to go through this. huhuh

00:01:18.768 --> 00:01:23.729
So I turned to journalism. But um I would like to get back into art.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.429
I did try um some article

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:29.922
did some paints and things like that um

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:34.815
ch And I bought a few ah things to try to start up again.

00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:39.541
This was several years ago and I never really progressed.

00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:43.389
huhuhhahaah I dropped and I

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:46.611
But I'd like to pick it up again because I did um

00:01:46.611 --> 00:01:49.464
into I or and may I

00:01:49.464 --> 00:01:54.307
Maybe there's certain kinds that draw me. You know, like that I like better. Because I think...

00:01:54.307 --> 00:01:59.065
I've always enjoyed drawing, but I always thought, well, I'd like to do something 

00:01:59.065 --> 00:02:02.271
in color. So um I naturally thought.

00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:05.006
Watercolor will be easiest to get into.

00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:09.173
And It's hard, really? I think

00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:15.936
ch yes yes

00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:21.390
Ohhh, yeah huhuhaaah

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.589
Yeah, it takes a lot of

00:02:24.513 --> 00:02:30.043
practice and I got these art books and yeah it's hard. It's hard to learn on your own.

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:33.692
So maybe if I went and took a class somewhere, it might be more fun.

00:02:33.692 --> 00:02:38.621
Yeah sure and my work huhhu might be that way huh

00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:42.467
mm..

00:02:43.751 --> 00:02:48.543
yeah you know it was just always

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:52.053
color pencils I did, Yeah, so and I enjoyed color pencils

00:02:52.053 --> 00:02:54.853
And and just the regular pencils, right?

00:02:54.853 --> 00:02:58.228
Um And I think that's probably the median threat.

00:02:58.228 --> 00:03:02.583
It's just the easiest, the one that I'm most familiar with and most comfortable with.

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:06.667
But it doesn't, I feel like I don't expand much beyond that.

00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:10.447
Um So I'd like to try my hand at something.

00:03:10.447 --> 00:03:14.311
And maybe watercolor is not the way to go. Maybe I should try it.

00:03:14.311 --> 00:03:19.305
Crayons are something, yeah, just to try something

00:03:21.752 --> 00:03:26.512
Yes, My sister used to do oil painting, and um she will

00:03:26.512 --> 00:03:29.430
Just so the kids can, yeah, just um...

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.519
It was a process and she would have to do it outside.

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.889
Because of the smells, right? huhuhaah um

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.472
So yes

00:03:40.045 --> 00:03:44.230
Have you ever taken any girl classes or what have you?

00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:47.656
okay okay

00:04:01.882 --> 00:04:06.336
Ch Ohh, okay. ohh

00:04:11.311 --> 00:04:15.584
Oh yes, Sneaky! We used to do that when I was a kid too.

00:04:15.584 --> 00:04:18.098
Yes umm..

00:04:18.098 --> 00:04:21.117
There is a reason for that. I haven't

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.511
I always thought of it as a Japanese huhu thing too

00:04:24.511 --> 00:04:27.650
and yes

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.294
