Oh I didn't know that.

00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:56.927

00:01:45.342 --> 00:01:49.441
Yeah, it used to be really cheap with everything else.

it's gone up yeah so it's still okay

00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:08.915
Everything has gone up, yeah. It's not just one place, it's everywhere.

00:02:24.728 --> 00:02:28.930

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.831

00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:35.814
And the cheap places are like $12, $13 now yeah

00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:42.953
yeah yeah

00:02:51.407 --> 00:02:54.799
Yeah even if they

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.697
but in japan even if the exchange rate is like 100 yen a dollar

00:02:58.697 --> 00:03:01.211
It's still cheap yeah

00:03:01.611 --> 00:03:06.488
So I don't, I don't, yeah, it's crazy. I feel like I'm going 20 years back in the past. Yeah.

00:03:47.787 --> 00:03:50.774
Ok so they know, yeah.

00:03:56.426 --> 00:04:00.899
Okay, honestly when I go to Japan I hardly ever stay at a hotel.

00:04:03.716 --> 00:04:07.175
I either stay at her grandma's place or my mom's place.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:22.818
But nice thing about Japan is even if you do get a cheap hotel, at least it's still clean.

00:04:24.203 --> 00:04:27.443
So like over here, you know, you look at the price you're like

00:04:27.443 --> 00:04:32.084
