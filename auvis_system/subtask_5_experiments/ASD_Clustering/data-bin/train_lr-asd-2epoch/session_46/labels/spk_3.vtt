00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:42.492

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.706
What is mean?

00:04:55.908 --> 00:04:59.115
Eat until you drop.

00:04:59.115 --> 00:05:02.776
there's like so much good food there you know like technically takoyaki and okonomiyaki

00:05:02.776 --> 00:05:07.079
big street foods in Osaka but they're also like iconic Japanese food so you don't put that

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:10.995
to put battera sushi and kushikatsu you know

00:05:13.627 --> 00:05:16.833
 it seemed like it was just like a proverb.

00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:19.516
It's like a proverb. Keep on eating.

00:05:19.516 --> 00:05:22.132
What was your source?

00:05:22.132 --> 00:05:27.127
We could be in a car drive

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:27.160
you

00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:37.218
These,They're the ones that came up with it.

00:05:37.218 --> 00:05:41.184
Yeah, it's a thing they say. Okay.

00:05:41.184 --> 00:05:45.977
so back to regional history

00:05:45.977 --> 00:05:50.971
Ho....what?

00:05:50.971 --> 00:05:54.093
Maybe in the broader Japan.

00:05:54.514 --> 00:05:56.708
But Hideyoshi died.

00:06:00.067 --> 00:06:03.475
(***)

00:06:06.023 --> 00:06:11.019
I mean maybe you can talk about how they grew that big in the first place.

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:11.406
Yeah.

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:16.384
Let's hear ,What? How else can I get such a bass so big? 

00:06:16.384 --> 00:06:19.641
 World War 2 last year.

00:06:24.502 --> 00:06:26.999
For one, it's a port, so big trade center.

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:30.088
Especially to the southern islands between there and Kyoto.

00:06:30.475 --> 00:06:34.069
So,it's like you know you just go in and that's it

00:06:34.795 --> 00:06:38.946
Because, you know, they didn't have cars in like 700years,They just had boats.

00:06:39.992 --> 00:06:44.110
um besides that there's also 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.903
trade center in general like apparently they like controlled all the rice

00:06:48.903 --> 00:06:53.477
and back then they measured wealth in rice. White Hong didn't really trade all that rice.
