WEBVTT

00:00:14.873 --> 00:00:15.641
Ro...

00:00:33.617 --> 00:00:37.295
Was there that many? I don't even know.

00:00:40.317 --> 00:00:41.994
Is there another romance?

00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:46.739
Yeah.

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:53.805
Oh. Okay.

00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:57.864
So, maybe eternally.

00:00:58.529 --> 00:01:00.012
Oh, I give up.

00:01:05.746 --> 00:01:08.512
Yeah. Yeah...

00:01:16.593 --> 00:01:20.198
Did you read the book too? Okay, I haven't read the book. So...

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:43.560
Yeah.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.005
Is it... this is

00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:59.476
you guys read the book? You know in the tail end of um...

00:01:59.476 --> 00:02:03.954
the movie they kind of did Samwise Gamgee kind of falling inlove.

00:02:04.692 --> 00:02:08.943
Did they have that in the book? Because I don't recall that scene at all in the book.

00:02:10.214 --> 00:02:11.205
They kinda did?

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.684
Okay.

00:02:20.096 --> 00:02:21.208
Each other.

00:02:24.925 --> 00:02:25.879
Okay.

00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:29.374
Okay.

00:02:32.028 --> 00:02:37.006
Right, it was there. Because I don't, I don't remember that at all from reading

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:37.887
the book.

00:02:39.086 --> 00:02:39.800
Yeah.

00:02:42.532 --> 00:02:43.497
Yeah.

00:02:44.192 --> 00:02:44.946
Yeah.

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:49.169
Does it.

00:02:56.094 --> 00:02:56.888
Oh...

00:02:57.044 --> 00:02:59.041
They named them all.

00:03:05.288 --> 00:03:06.637
What happen?

00:03:08.322 --> 00:03:11.224
I don't remember that, like...

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:17.530
Yeah.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.684
What...

00:03:23.611 --> 00:03:28.055
Yeah. And Tolkien has a whole...

00:03:28.087 --> 00:03:29.164
world.

00:03:31.053 --> 00:03:32.204
Yeah.

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:34.334
Yeah.

00:03:42.933 --> 00:03:44.962
Oh. Yeah, Elvish.

00:04:00.785 --> 00:04:04.470
Oh, definitely... the old.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.508
Yes.

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:13.110
Kind of.

00:04:15.051 --> 00:04:18.629
Wait, which one would you like, the older kind or the newer one?

00:04:20.164 --> 00:04:22.163
So you can actually communicate.

00:04:28.737 --> 00:04:33.732
My God. Something magical about word.

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:35.668
That has power.

00:04:36.853 --> 00:04:39.081
It's just fascinating.

00:05:01.014 --> 00:05:01.786
Yeah.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.105
Oh.

00:05:19.465 --> 00:05:20.504
Sma...

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:26.404
But it's amazing like how he create it.

00:05:38.455 --> 00:05:40.557
But, when they made

00:05:40.557 --> 00:05:44.893
the movie or the rings, they actually hire linguists to create

00:05:44.893 --> 00:05:47.643
that. And then, that

00:05:47.763 --> 00:05:51.644
I think that movie started a trend, coz then

00:05:51.525 --> 00:05:56.148
I don't know if you're like big fan of... I don't think he did games,

00:05:56.148 --> 00:05:58.107
game of thrones like

00:05:58.275 --> 00:06:02.545
where they had the whole language developed for that.

00:06:02.545 --> 00:06:07.299
And so like they, actually these linguists get paid.

00:06:09.648 --> 00:06:14.172
Like they, like to create a whole new language, yeah.
