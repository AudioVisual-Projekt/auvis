WEBVTT

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.275
Okay.

00:00:38.426 --> 00:00:42.663
For my mom and dad i am the only child

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.926
With everyone together, my mom's says they are three of us.

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:54.442
and each of us have a different dad.

00:00:54.442 --> 00:00:57.833
And on my dad's side there was...

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:02.828
Stepmom had a daughter and she was like my age, maybe almost a year older.

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:07.824
And so we got along really good and then they have five kids together.

00:01:07.824 --> 00:01:10.220
Yeah, food family.

00:01:14.034 --> 00:01:16.531
No while

00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:21.357
when I would go to my dad's house, like they never invited my brother to come or anything like that.

00:01:21.357 --> 00:01:23.872
They considered very separate

00:01:23.872 --> 00:01:28.005
Umm it's just craziness

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:32.207
Umm yeah and so but

00:01:32.207 --> 00:01:36.460
My brothers and sisters, meeting my older , my step sister

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.336
I don't see them as anything but my brothers and sisters because I don't know any different.

00:01:41.336 --> 00:01:45.032
They are just yeah, they're just my brothers and sisters.

00:01:45.032 --> 00:01:50.028
But I would always compare the different households.

00:01:50.028 --> 00:01:55.023
Yeah, because you had chaos and and...

00:01:55.023 --> 00:01:59.647
all kinds of craze and drama queens

00:01:59.647 --> 00:02:04.067
you got stability and love but it was chaos because of there were so many kids

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:08.927
but it was more like you had a dad who was...

00:02:08.927 --> 00:02:11.526
Both working and then...

00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:14.412
My stepmom eventually went back to work but it's like...

00:02:14.412 --> 00:02:17.517
They were two people established stable.

00:02:17.517 --> 00:02:21.939
Everything was good, they had like a home, they kept the same homes.

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.561
where my mom's house was like crazy(***)

00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:30.309
novella style, right? And so

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:32.822
There was a lot of, just a lot of.

00:02:32.822 --> 00:02:37.817
So i feel completely different how i felt. And I didn't feel like I fit in either.

00:02:37.817 --> 00:02:41.142
But my grandpa's house was like...

00:02:41.142 --> 00:02:45.344
Yeah, and so I was really close with my cousins too.

00:02:45.344 --> 00:02:48.161
It was weird because on my mom's side of the family...

00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:52.381
None of us really had our dads in the picture. Our grandfather was like our dad.

00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:56.178
Yeah, and i did see my dad..

00:02:56.178 --> 00:02:58.793
I mean, I went to their house every other weekend.

00:02:58.793 --> 00:03:01.881
So it's not like he was, you know, but I mean...

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:04.565
He was going to school, he was working.

00:03:04.565 --> 00:03:08.666
He was a father of like, you know, seven kids.

00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:11.280
So I understand 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.014
adult after therapy.

00:03:14.014 --> 00:03:17.339
I had a real like with him before.

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:21.119
with all of them until I like until I went through

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:25.961
therapy and God kind of revealed to me a therapy that gave me a different perspective.

00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:30.889
Not necessarily because they didn't love you, they didn't care for you but they were young when all that happened.

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.708
and they needed to figure out themselves.

00:03:33.708 --> 00:03:38.651
and they had other stuff going on and unfortunately you fell through the cracks.

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:42.971
So once I realized it wasn't like a personal thing.

00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:46.633
I mean it still kind of shows a little bit, but I mean I'm healed with that now and I'm forgiven.

00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:49.554
and then move passed out but

00:03:49.554 --> 00:03:53.891
But it's crazy what if i (***)

00:04:25.076 --> 00:04:27.607
right

00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:47.182
Did you live together?

00:04:59.973 --> 00:05:01.255
Right.

00:05:06.892 --> 00:05:10.063
Yeah, that's a bigger step.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.276
Yeah, yeah

00:05:32.846 --> 00:05:37.098
would you see him like..

00:05:37.098 --> 00:05:42.093
so to like take care of towards his father..father's house or..

00:05:42.093 --> 00:05:43.358
or his

00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:57.483
Oh wow.

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:06.005
uh huh

00:06:17.226 --> 00:06:20.264
Wow, what an interesting...

00:06:20.264 --> 00:06:24.567
but like at the house did he always like see your dad as his dad?

00:06:24.567 --> 00:06:26.305
Or not worthy
