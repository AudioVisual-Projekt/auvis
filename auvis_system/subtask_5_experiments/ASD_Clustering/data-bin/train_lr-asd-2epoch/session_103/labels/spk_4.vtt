WEBVTT

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.662
What about, what about like the...

00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:18.293
Dis... like...

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.607
Golden couple of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.

00:00:27.812 --> 00:00:31.272
I don't think anybody watched Joe vs. Mario.

00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:32.221
Ha, ha, ha...

00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:35.461
Ha... ha... ha...    Yeah...

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.693
Sleepless together.

00:00:45.316 --> 00:00:50.260
I like you got male better. I think because it's like, um, it's a quality.

00:00:51.154 --> 00:00:53.770
It takes place in New York.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.672
and I love the whole like

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.495
Interaction between like the great character

00:01:02.517 --> 00:01:04.829
Dave Chappelle comes out on it, which is

00:01:16.197 --> 00:01:18.036
Translate well

00:01:33.837 --> 00:01:37.330
She's corination (***) like magic.

00:01:37.307 --> 00:01:41.307
That movie was really cute and we still like...

00:01:41.263 --> 00:01:44.604
My friends will be like M F E O

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.681
Not everybody knows what that means, so made for each other.

00:01:48.681 --> 00:01:53.575
Okay ...            Yeah... yeah...i

00:01:58.283 --> 00:02:02.520
Two things about the movie that don't necessarily talk about the story that I

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.033
absolutely love are the soundtracks.

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:10.029
Especially Sleepless in Seattle. I have that on CD. So good.

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:14.179
and the sets like Meg Ryan's like

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:18.686
living areas in both movies i'm like i want to move there

00:02:18.686 --> 00:02:23.680
i want my apartment to look like that like the sets to me were just amazing

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.238
See?

00:02:35.948 --> 00:02:38.479
I love that them...    Yeah

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:48.520
That's like a statement.

00:02:51.306 --> 00:02:53.479
Ha, ha, ha...

00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:56.963
Ha, ha, ha...

00:02:57.178 --> 00:03:01.042
My sister went to the restaurant. Yeah.

00:03:02.156 --> 00:03:05.160
I don't know where at in New York City but

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.871
Somewhere... I'll ask her and then I'll let you know.

00:03:08.871 --> 00:03:12.061
But I think it'd be cool because I've never been to New York City.

00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:16.297
to go and to do a tour of all like the movie spots

00:03:18.843 --> 00:03:20.595
Yeah...

00:03:22.305 --> 00:03:24.667
Yeah, but Harry, my salad is so good.

00:03:40.514 --> 00:03:42.399
Ha, ha, ha...

00:03:42.705 --> 00:03:46.149
I saw it many times.

00:03:46.215 --> 00:03:50.467
Ryan Reynolds Sandra Bullock

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:53.438
It is time.

00:04:05.931 --> 00:04:07.926
Ohhhh...

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:13.398
Ha, ha, ha...

00:04:33.195 --> 00:04:36.010
Ha, ha, ha...

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:45.622
Ha.. ha.. ha...ha.. ha.. ha.. ha.. 

00:04:58.408 --> 00:05:03.233
It's supposed to be weak, it's a rom.com

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:04.864
Hmm...

00:05:11.468 --> 00:05:13.862
Ha, ha, ha...

00:05:13.966 --> 00:05:18.589
She's going to be like that. She's going to be like, it was magic.

00:05:23.545 --> 00:05:27.443
I want a full report. ha..ha..ha..  I want a full report.

00:05:29.593 --> 00:05:32.428
First time I've said that in my life.

00:05:35.937 --> 00:05:40.932
Why can't I think of what other rom-coms? There's tons! Why can't I think of any off the top of my head?

00:05:40.932 --> 00:05:41.505
for you.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.543
She is not my fave.

00:05:56.193 --> 00:05:59.230
Oh, how to lose a guy in 10 days?

00:06:00.255 --> 00:06:02.415
Yeah...

00:06:02.834 --> 00:06:03.898
Yeah...

00:06:04.017 --> 00:06:06.853
That was a cute one too.

00:06:06.853 --> 00:06:10.447
I also like Reese Witherspoon too.

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:14.305
She had a cute one about the Alabama.
