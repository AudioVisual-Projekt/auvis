00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:58.966
When I first heard it, it sounded so much like...

00:02:58.966 --> 00:03:02.376
the beauty and the beast from Disney when you first see it.

00:03:02.376 --> 00:03:06.376

00:04:46.816 --> 00:04:49.245
Okay... okay...

00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:23.686
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

00:05:24.835 --> 00:05:29.643
I don't know very much about ballet. I just know that the Nutcracker.

00:05:29.604 --> 00:05:31.078
Ha,.. ha,.. ha.. 

00:05:39.044 --> 00:05:41.845
I've never seen like this one leg

00:05:41.845 --> 00:05:44.410
Before with...

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.797
Yeah, but what's crazy is that the only ballet that I've ever...

00:05:48.797 --> 00:05:52.864
I can recognize the Tchaikovsky ones. Tchaikovsky?

00:05:52.864 --> 00:05:57.741
Yeah, I know there's other composers who have done...

00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:02.583
So you did ballet for how long?

00:06:15.536 --> 00:06:17.056
Hmm...

00:06:18.193 --> 00:06:22.261
And what made you like to say, Can you break from there...?

00:06:23.677 --> 00:06:25.044
Okaay...

00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:32.425
Hmm...

00:06:32.865 --> 00:06:35.531
What? What was the ummm

00:06:35.693 --> 00:06:38.427
Because I know in ballet, you have like, the positions.

00:06:38.427 --> 00:06:41.599
Is that all ballet is? It's just like a...

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:45.463
of putting the different positions together.

00:06:45.463 --> 00:06:48.871
or is there like other moves that are not the tradition?
