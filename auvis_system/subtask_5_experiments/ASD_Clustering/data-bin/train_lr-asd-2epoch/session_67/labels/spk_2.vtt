It's a really monster type of thing.

00:01:50.463 --> 00:01:53.618
And the monster comes and at the end...

00:01:53.618 --> 00:01:58.430
The main character with little son. and

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.617
people who survived, they were just waiting.

00:02:01.617 --> 00:02:04.183
to be eaten by this monster.

And I'll be the sixth one.

00:02:18.426 --> 00:02:23.420
eaten by the monster. So he decides to shoot every one of them.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.307
including his son and then

00:02:26.307 --> 00:02:29.598
that movie ends at the end of the movie.

00:02:29.598 --> 00:02:34.219
