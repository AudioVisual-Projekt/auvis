WEBVTT

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:16.088
Okay yeah yeah yeah

00:00:16.088 --> 00:00:18.519
yeah

00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:24.797
yeah yeah yeah yeah it (***)

00:00:24.797 --> 00:00:25.843
Yeah.

00:00:29.454 --> 00:00:33.942
yeah but i think (***)

00:00:34.483 --> 00:00:39.106
no snapping turtle (***)

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:44.101
snapping turtle (***)

00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:44.134
you

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:47.259
yeah yeah

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.286
Camping turtles are one of my favorite.

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:56.960
yeah (***) There's a difference between a snapping turtle and an alligator.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.436
(***) i think (***)

00:01:02.698 --> 00:01:06.765
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think so. Yeah.

00:01:08.621 --> 00:01:13.278
They can like bite your finger 

00:01:14.644 --> 00:01:18.763
they can like like buy like a carrot like remember like they do

00:01:18.763 --> 00:01:22.947
So back to the topic of Gamera

00:01:22.947 --> 00:01:26.912
yeah yeah yeah

00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:35.587
no I think you just saw that too. yeah but then (***)

00:01:35.587 --> 00:01:38.810
I didn't notice about that.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.691
Opposite to Gojira. Gojira started out kind of cute looking.

00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:46.218
and became very mean, but for Gunmera...

00:01:46.218 --> 00:01:50.673
He looked really mean at the beginning, the old one.

00:01:50.673 --> 00:01:54.403
But then he starts to become cuter in the new ones.

00:01:58.015 --> 00:01:59.669
yeah

00:02:01.692 --> 00:02:04.798
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Much kinder.

00:02:08.206 --> 00:02:13.202
At first, they didn't know them. They were like, oh, no, they're monsters.

00:02:13.202 --> 00:02:17.892
(***)

00:02:17.892 --> 00:02:19.917
yeah

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.489
yeah yeah which one

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.733
Oh, which one?

00:02:38.716 --> 00:02:42.497
Hey, hey, hey, yeah. That one. Yeah, exactly.

00:02:43.547 --> 00:02:44.774
yeah

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.825
yeah yeah yeah

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:52.963
yeah yeah

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.241
Oh, that is a good question.

00:02:58.241 --> 00:03:01.429
maybe the monster but like you know maybe

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:04.890
It's deceiving. like (***)

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.868
People were like, they... It seems like he kind of like made a test gun barrel or something.

00:03:09.868 --> 00:03:11.606
yeah yeah

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.833
yeah Probably. But I guess the monster got saved.  (***)

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:21.765
how do you say it like the maybe the yeah maybe like

00:03:21.765 --> 00:03:26.034
The monster knew that the Gamera would...

00:03:26.034 --> 00:03:28.547
getting in the way of eating the food.

00:03:28.547 --> 00:03:33.542
(***) Gamera

00:03:33.542 --> 00:03:38.352
And then go, yeah.

00:03:38.352 --> 00:03:40.783
Yeah, without flexing.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.993
Kind of, yeah, yeah, yeah. (***)

00:03:47.751 --> 00:03:48.916
Yeah?

00:03:50.402 --> 00:03:54.789
It was, it was (***) yeah

00:03:57.168 --> 00:03:58.848
yeah

00:03:59.142 --> 00:04:02.297
yeah yeah

00:04:02.297 --> 00:04:06.956
Yeah, he was. yeah

00:04:08.018 --> 00:04:10.971
I don't know. I guess maybe the director or something?

00:04:10.971 --> 00:04:13.892
You didn't like that, but once you heard it, (***)

00:04:13.892 --> 00:04:16.709
Yeah (***)

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.730
Yeah, yeah, yeah

00:04:24.336 --> 00:04:24.843
yeah yeah

00:04:26.147 --> 00:04:27.987
yeah yeah

00:04:30.412 --> 00:04:34.715
(***) Gamera 

00:04:34.715 --> 00:04:39.186
I know this is the newer, I mean the live action.

00:04:39.186 --> 00:04:44.114
(***) Gamera (***) 

00:04:44.114 --> 00:04:48.941
no not the animation

00:04:50.898 --> 00:04:54.105
The real person one. The one we like. That one.

00:04:59.218 --> 00:05:01.917
yeah i guess but then like near the end

00:05:05.782 --> 00:05:10.321
I guess but near the end he became bigger.

00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:12.953
but then i don't think he would oh yeah so he never really liked that

00:05:12.953 --> 00:05:15.602
I don't want to get it on me because they're sharing scenes

00:05:15.602 --> 00:05:18.961
Okay. Yeah.

00:05:18.961 --> 00:05:23.956
Yeah, I guess. Yeah, that makes sense. But then they should do another movie.

00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:26.150
That's smooth, yeah?

00:05:27.286 --> 00:05:28.993
yeah

00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:35.364
2000 something. Like 2004.

00:05:35.364 --> 00:05:37.862
Yeah, I probably would.

00:05:38.118 --> 00:05:40.412
yeah yeah

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.953
i guess we can't or unless they use the boy

00:05:47.295 --> 00:05:52.273
Yeah, yeah, yeah, after the, when the camera, oh, (***)

00:05:52.273 --> 00:05:52.931
yeah

00:05:55.141 --> 00:05:59.629
this should have grammy or come out in a hollywood bug film that would be pretty accurately

00:06:04.776 --> 00:06:08.456
Yeah, yeah, but then yeah

00:06:08.456 --> 00:06:11.138
yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:06:11.138 --> 00:06:14.429
Yeah, but they got married more like
