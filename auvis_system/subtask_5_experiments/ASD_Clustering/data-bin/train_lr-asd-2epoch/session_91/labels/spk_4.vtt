WEBVTT

00:00:15.623 --> 00:00:17.445
Alright. What's that?

00:00:21.686 --> 00:00:22.771
mmh

00:00:22.912 --> 00:00:24.981
It's okay, you can share all of them. 

00:00:25.913 --> 00:00:27.601
We have two more sessions.

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.331
Wow.

00:00:38.516 --> 00:00:39.602

00:00:47.972 --> 00:00:49.459
Oh...

00:00:49.673 --> 00:00:50.598
mmh

00:00:51.248 --> 00:00:52.736
mmh

00:00:56.933 --> 00:01:00.637
Nice. That's like, that's one of the best kind of music.

00:01:00.557 --> 00:01:05.501
It's like when you have like a visceral, like physical reaction to something.

00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:06.501
I love that.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.236
mmh

00:01:12.748 --> 00:01:14.907
Wow. Wow. 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.164
mmh

00:01:21.704 --> 00:01:22.869
mmh

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.333
Interesting.

00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:28.112
mmh

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.269
Very nice. Well...

00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:49.503
Sam's would be K.U.S.C. It's not even a genre. It's like that.

00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:01.467
mmh

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.526
mmh

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:17.328
like the gospel music like what kind of like do you have like an artist?

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.396
Wow. Oh. Nice.

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:33.176
mmh

00:03:01.568 --> 00:03:02.613
mmh

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:12.277
mmh

00:03:12.313 --> 00:03:13.117
Yeah. 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.143
mmh

00:03:14.177 --> 00:03:15.838
Yeah. yeah, yeah.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:19.363
Yeah. 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:24.607
I don't know.

00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:31.426
mmh

00:03:36.552 --> 00:03:37.396
mmh

00:03:40.164 --> 00:03:44.552
Right, like, but that's like all about like finding music that can really speak

00:03:44.512 --> 00:03:49.220
to the masses while still conveying the message, the gospel, right?

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.193
I feel like that's kind of what Yoshi's person is doing.

00:03:53.193 --> 00:03:57.884
yeah there's this rapper, is he a rapper? Yeah.

00:03:57.884 --> 00:04:00.955
It was like this artist now, and then in Japan.

00:04:00.955 --> 00:04:05.831
he's like like really like hard like rock no rap

00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:08.987
Rap, like hip hop probably, right?

00:04:08.987 --> 00:04:13.983
and then like he's playing at the budokan which is one of it's like staple center it's like one of the

00:04:13.983 --> 00:04:17.374
one of the big biggest arenas like in Japan.

00:04:17.374 --> 00:04:21.543
But he's like like his tour is called what?

00:04:21.543 --> 00:04:24.242
Jesus is alive or Jesus loves you.

00:04:24.242 --> 00:04:29.220
yeah that's in japan and then like people are like flocking to him you know

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.540
And I don't think there's ever been an artist that

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.523
puts it that much forward in the presentation of the music.

00:04:37.523 --> 00:04:42.451
you know like black gospel it could kind of still be like oh yeah the groove and it could it could be like about the music

00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:46.619
but the lyrics are about the gospel, right?

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:49.370
But for this guy, he's like...

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.504
Like on the stage, like there's a cross behind it.

00:04:53.423 --> 00:04:57.962
And his name, the name is like, Jesus loves you. It's like.

00:04:58.043 --> 00:05:01.384
Bam, if you want the gospels. Feel like it.

00:05:05.165 --> 00:05:06.278
I don't know.

00:05:11.732 --> 00:05:13.627
Right? mmh...

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:28.624
mmh

00:05:30.425 --> 00:05:35.100
But I feel like they do that by themselves because in Japan, like the minute you say

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.762
something religious, you know, like people shut down.

00:05:38.762 --> 00:05:42.997
I think it's like like really really quickly. So, like

00:05:42.997 --> 00:05:47.521
But that's I wonder what kind of people go to his concerts. You know.

00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:52.177
Yeah. Yeah. that's that is amazing, right?

00:05:52.177 --> 00:05:55.283
So like I'm just wondering like what is that?

00:05:55.283 --> 00:05:57.932
The... What's like? Yeah.

00:05:57.932 --> 00:06:02.927
drawing I- I guess the music is really good and it's really good too but like

00:06:02.927 --> 00:06:07.587
I wonder like how many people who are actually there really understand.

00:06:07.788 --> 00:06:09.879
what it's about. Yeah.

00:06:14.468 --> 00:06:16.911
Yeah, that's that's why I know him. Yeah.
