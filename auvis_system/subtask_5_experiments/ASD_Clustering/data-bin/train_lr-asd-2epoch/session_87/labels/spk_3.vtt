WEBVTT

00:00:19.563 --> 00:00:23.435
Alright, gear one up, and then...

00:00:23.935 --> 00:00:27.663
So you were telling me that you, after you... um

00:00:27.663 --> 00:00:32.456
If you go into the um jury thing, you can't go anywhere for like a year?

00:00:35.174 --> 00:00:37.093
Unconforming.

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:48.454
For a year? Even if you're like somewhere?

00:00:50.097 --> 00:00:50.697
Yeah.

00:00:53.143 --> 00:00:53.908
Uh...

00:00:56.335 --> 00:00:59.491
For this, for that case.? Yes?

00:01:01.363 --> 00:01:05.464
Okay, But if you're called like you have to drop everything and go?

00:01:08.782 --> 00:01:12.113
Like if, Do they tell you not to travel during that time?

00:01:16.327 --> 00:01:16.993
Yeah.

00:01:17.824 --> 00:01:23.352
Uh, uh, uh, never mind. Okay. Understand. Okay.

00:01:28.578 --> 00:01:29.344
Oh.

00:01:29.814 --> 00:01:32.936
Wow, did you make a lot of like...

00:01:32.936 --> 00:01:37.599
like fake iti- itineraries just in case?

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:42.033
Oh wow, that kind of would suck. Like if we are

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:45.542
Like, say like you need to go somewhere?

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:48.971
and then they call you like if you are...

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.521
Like there, if you're like...

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.798
out of the country, like, you can't really come out, right? Do you have to come back?

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:06.817
Oh, yeah. Makes sense.

00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:09.041
mmh

00:02:10.616 --> 00:02:11.449
mmh

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:15.053
Makes sense. Have you ever been to France?

00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:27.375
Like a... Alright, I think that's okay. Okay.

00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:29.890
Alright, so France

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.047
Have you ever been to France? No?

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.142
Yeah I've been there a couple times. Yeah, so... It's beautiful!

00:02:38.142 --> 00:02:40.892
It's very like...uh

00:02:40.892 --> 00:02:44.324
Picturesque. Very, very picturesque.

00:02:44.923 --> 00:02:49.430
Um I don't know. I've traveled Europe a lot actually. It's like, like

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.446
compared to other cities.

00:02:51.946 --> 00:02:55.051
It's very art... Again, like little tourist destiny.

00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:59.441
But it's still like beautiful and there's a lot of history there.

00:03:00.306 --> 00:03:04.436
And... I don't know, it kind of feels like you're in a picture book a little bit.

00:03:04.802 --> 00:03:09.596
just because like the architecture is so different from what's around here, you know?

00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:14.592
Um the culture is a little bit different. The eating culture is different.

00:03:15.172 --> 00:03:16.104
Um...

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:21.493
What else? And it's like you read about like a lot of French things. Like

00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:24.211
and like the history books and stuff, right?

00:03:24.211 --> 00:03:26.792
And that's kind of what you see.

00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:29.475
So it's a little bit surreal too.

00:03:30.141 --> 00:03:32.613
It's, it's very beautiful, I guess.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.203
Yeah, this time we're going to go up a little bit out of Paris.

00:03:37.203 --> 00:03:41.592
Last time I was there, we we stayed in virus for the whole time.

00:03:41.592 --> 00:03:45.523
but this time we're going to go up north to Mont Saint-Michel which is

00:03:45.523 --> 00:03:48.342
like, way, like, northwest.

00:03:48.342 --> 00:03:53.337
of Paris, and then it's the island and the ocean. It's like the castle and the ocean.

00:03:53.836 --> 00:03:57.048
and then during the the low tide.

00:03:57.182 --> 00:04:01.554
You're able to cross and go into the castle area and see it.

00:04:01.554 --> 00:04:06.549
but like if you don't leave until like before the the high tide ends.

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.987
Or low tide ends, so you're stuck there. Yeah, because like, you know.

00:04:10.987 --> 00:04:13.203
The, the road disappears.

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:18.565
So we're going to do that. We're kind of looking forward to that. And then we're going to go to Monet's house.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:24.421
Romay? Monet. Monet. Monet. Yeah, he's a painter.

00:04:24.887 --> 00:04:27.303
The painter. Yeah.

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:31.879
so the impressionist here so he it's where he

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:36.300
Drew like a lot of his stuff, so we're gonna go there. Yeah.

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:37.669
What else?

00:04:39.433 --> 00:04:40.099
Yeah.

00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:50.374
Really close, right? I've been to... South

00:04:50.374 --> 00:04:54.896
10 years ago, my family went on this uh cruise.

00:04:54.896 --> 00:04:58.086
and it was from Italy and we went around the booths.

00:04:58.086 --> 00:05:01.984
And then we went around the Mediterranean cities.

00:05:01.984 --> 00:05:04.499
and then we went to

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:07.975
Monte Carlo and then Barcelona.

00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:11.400
And then Barcelona is only two hours away from France.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.948
So that's where we went.

00:05:13.948 --> 00:05:18.777
And then from there, we, we flew to Paris. And so

00:05:18.677 --> 00:05:22.032
Barcelona, but I really love Barcelona. I've been to Barcelona a couple times.

00:05:22.032 --> 00:05:24.467
But It's kind of like L.A.

00:05:25.233 --> 00:05:27.448
It's very, there's like a lot of like...

00:05:27.448 --> 00:05:32.444
a mix match of different cultures, a lot of people, food. um

00:05:32.444 --> 00:05:38.038
And it feels very like it feels very comfortable like an ocean town just like LA.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.982
That's kind of fun.

00:05:40.881 --> 00:05:44.711
What else? But the kotatsu are like nice.

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:46.577
um Monte Carlo

00:05:47.276 --> 00:05:52.001
um I forget what's next door to that, but like there's like these little...

00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:54.599
This city is really really beautiful. 

00:05:54.794 --> 00:05:55.526
Um...

00:05:55.764 --> 00:05:58.869
Definitely a to do if you have, if you've never been.

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:02.869
you just get on a train and you just hop on like every single

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:06.429
like um every single uh...

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:09.535
station is just like so distinct and

00:06:09.834 --> 00:06:13.669
Cannes. That's where, that's where the Koteshwor.  yeah, so

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:18.663
If you go during like the the film festival, it's like, it's bougie.

00:06:18.663 --> 00:06:19.879
Bougie.
