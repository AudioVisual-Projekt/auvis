00:00:24.484 --> 00:00:29.480
Yeah, what were you talking about? Oh yeah, you started going to that church in Costa Mesa.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.442
Okay.

00:01:17.152 --> 00:01:21.488
So you went already to Japan one time for a summer mission?

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.221
Oh, to get to know their ministry and how things are going to be.

00:01:39.308 --> 00:01:40.168
Okay.

00:02:05.043 --> 00:02:09.480
Get on a podcast or something and just listen to the same thing again and again and again and again.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.367
That's how kids learn. Like get a little like

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:14.981
I am... I've been trying to learn Swiss German.

00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:19.200
I've always wanted to learn it because my mom spoke Swiss German.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.377
when I was little, but then my parents realized.

00:02:22.727 --> 00:02:25.275
They didn't know anyone who was teaching their kids two languages.

00:02:25.275 --> 00:02:30.169
and they remembered how hard it was for them to learn English, so they decided not to teach us German.

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:32.411
But then when we got older about

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.971
8 to 9 years old. They found a new  family came to our church and their kids were bilingual and they went to German school

00:02:36.971 --> 00:02:41.306
on saturdays. My parents made me and my siblings go to German school.

00:02:41.306 --> 00:02:46.301
For three years. At first we really wanted to go, but then after a while we wanted to quit.

00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:50.183
We had school every day. We had school Monday to Friday, and Saturday morning we had school.

00:02:50.183 --> 00:02:52.698
we watch cartoons on Saturday morning at church.

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:56.077
We have church Sunday night and we have church Wednesday night.

00:02:56.038 --> 00:03:01.033
There was no break, but it was good. I was really glad, and my parents said, oh, you'll thank us someday.

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:06.301
and I was like, no I won't, but actually now I'm really glad that I did coz

00:03:06.535 --> 00:03:08.881
And I did take one German course.

00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:12.931
in college and then I spent some time in Germany and Switzerland, and I couldn't pick it up.

00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:18.120
so fast now I'm trying to learn Swiss German and I have this podcast the same one I listen to the same one again and again

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.626
It's just like a 10-minute one where

00:03:20.626 --> 00:03:25.621
they go and they ask people what did you eat for breakfast and they ask something answer this?

00:03:25.621 --> 00:03:29.621
And then they put how they write it out on the parchment.

00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:33.822
Because if I want, I can look into what it means in German, what it means in 

00:03:33.822 --> 00:03:36.371
English and what it means in Europe. I actually listen

00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:40.183
It's just whenever I went in the park or I just listened to this podcast.

00:03:40.183 --> 00:03:43.271
I could understand so much of this German. I was surprised.

00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:45.888
I was in Switzerland again this last year.

00:03:45.888 --> 00:03:50.276
And um... I stayed with some of my cousins. I did a lot of stuff there with my husband and stuff.

00:03:50.276 --> 00:03:54.157
And I was finding I really understanding a lot of things. It was quite different.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:59.730
from German because like a lot of the words are the same but they pronounce them differently but I like that but...

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.079
You do for Japanese before I went to Japan the first time, I had a...

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.200
a cassette tape and there was about a 20 minute or 30 minute section where

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.555
Or they just went through all the things like like, for example, Oh... whatever.

00:04:11.555 --> 00:04:14.895
a station eki eki doko desu ka

00:04:14.895 --> 00:04:18.270
um... church kyokai doko de dinko doko de

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.105
He learned some sentence patterns, like how to say where is something.

00:04:21.105 --> 00:04:25.796
And then, which direction, you know, ite, masugu, or...

00:04:25.796 --> 00:04:30.176
What's right, what's left? Counting, how to ask for something crossed.

00:04:42.318 --> 00:04:46.570
Oh, it'll be so cute. But you listen to the same ones again and again and again and again.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.279
And pretty soon, it just becomes so natural. And then you get a new one.

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:55.936
I listen to that one again and again because I noticed when my kids were little I used to play like um...

00:04:55.936 --> 00:04:58.652
Donut mandolin So what I'm just trying to did

00:04:58.652 --> 00:05:01.301
There'd be kids singing and there'd be talking.

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:05.520
And they literally couldn't even hardly talk to themselves and they have all the words memorized.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.145
And he knew what everything meant. And I think it really helped their relevance.

00:05:10.145 --> 00:05:15.056
To watch the same ones again and again. Plus they were learning songs about God and things like that, right?

00:05:15.056 --> 00:05:19.089
and some of the songs are ones that we sing in church. But I just thought...

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.543
I know I know that I could really, even at my age.

00:05:22.582 --> 00:05:25.839
I know that I could be considered in a language if I would be...

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.795
um... merge. We adopted two girls from Ukraine.

00:05:30.833 --> 00:05:34.563
Within three months and I was on all these different groups and no matter how smart

00:05:34.563 --> 00:05:39.558
kids were however not very bright or even if they weren't good students in three months these kids

00:05:39.558 --> 00:05:44.383
They were, they could, well, enough to be able to make themselves under

00:05:44.383 --> 00:05:48.417
and actually even the grammar is starting to be normalized after a few months.

00:05:56.214 --> 00:05:59.773
Just listen to it in your car again. Same stuff again and again and again.

00:05:59.773 --> 00:06:02.321
And also Duolingo is actually really good.

00:06:02.321 --> 00:06:07.181
I love Duolingo. It's really helped fill in some of my Japanese gaps.

00:06:07.181 --> 00:06:11.688
Also I took um... a PCC, I took Japanese 1.

00:06:11.688 --> 00:06:15.063
There's a really excellent teacher. She's not teaching next semester.

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:19.888
Um... but Hannah took Japanese 1, 2, and 3 with her.
