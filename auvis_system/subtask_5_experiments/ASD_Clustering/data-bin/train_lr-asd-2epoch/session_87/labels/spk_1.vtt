00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.830
Marquette, so...

00:00:22.328 --> 00:00:23.276
I'm stuck.

00:00:24.288 --> 00:00:25.397
Oh.

00:00:25.297 --> 00:00:28.604
First time in a...   Yes!

00:00:28.604 --> 00:00:31.373
So then I started going to the church in Piscinissa.

00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:34.910
And I went there in the first day. I just knew that trust 

00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:37.575
to go to church and I know it's an hour from my house.

00:00:37.654 --> 00:00:41.164
But I was like, God, you're going to provide for the gas.

00:00:41.878 --> 00:00:44.946
You know like... But it's been really...

00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:49.209
It's been so great and the first day I told...

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:52.466
I would like to thank Pastor Paul and my heart for the humility.

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:57.262
and he's like my father-in-law has a church in Japan that they teach English he told it to me.

00:00:57.421 --> 00:01:01.589
I was like, what? And then, like three months later, now I'm in Japan.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:04.868
going on like a mission trip and so...

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:05.994
Um...

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:10.590
You know, I'm going to be now... you know um...

00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:15.426
I'm planning on going as a missionary and moving up there. by the end of weekend.

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:19.551
Mmh. Mmh.

00:01:20.621 --> 00:01:24.293
No, no, no. It was just to go like to the church to see like...

00:01:24.293 --> 00:01:27.060
about their school, yeah, so I...

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.823
I ended up finding out that they don't teach specifically the

00:01:30.783 --> 00:01:33.719
Fijikomali but the Futoku...

00:01:34.313 --> 00:01:38.397
The kids who like, don't go to school.

00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:39.813
and um...

00:01:40.677 --> 00:01:45.302
So it, it's just like, I felt like God was opening doors and establishing community.

00:01:45.302 --> 00:01:48.947
even though I didn't know the language. And I mean, I have been learning.

00:01:48.947 --> 00:01:53.334
But it's so hard. It's something about my brain doesn't want to like...

00:01:53.334 --> 00:01:57.097
But I think it's just like laying foundation to

00:01:57.097 --> 00:01:59.509
layer after layer after layer to get the language.

00:01:59.962 --> 00:02:00.715
so...

00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:03.956
I'm on my way... Yeah.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.892
mmh

00:02:28.377 --> 00:02:29.368
Oh.

00:02:41.783 --> 00:02:42.677
Wow...

00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:48.268
Yeah

00:02:52.847 --> 00:02:56.085
It's like, they didn't even have a break.

00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:29.287
almost...

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.401
Wow.

00:03:44.785 --> 00:03:45.657
Uh-huh.

00:03:56.927 --> 00:04:01.500
Right, and I'm sure that there's like the own vernacular, right?

00:04:25.585 --> 00:04:29.584
They... Yeah. They just... they just...

00:04:29.584 --> 00:04:31.660
YouTube channel where they have like

00:04:32.044 --> 00:04:34.727
It's like an onigiri and a hamburger.

00:04:34.727 --> 00:04:39.722
Yeah, it's cartoons, but they do these little things. It's a little conversation.

00:04:39.722 --> 00:04:42.792
So funny. They're really cute.

00:05:05.424 --> 00:05:06.375
Wow.

00:05:12.696 --> 00:05:13.546
Right!

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:22.422
mmh

00:05:28.807 --> 00:05:29.639
mmh

00:05:38.751 --> 00:05:40.682
Picked up the language.

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:51.240
And that's my goal before I live. I want to be like...

00:05:51.795 --> 00:05:54.595
at least pretty conversational.

00:05:55.727 --> 00:05:56.857
Yeah

00:06:01.351 --> 00:06:03.848
I do duo lingo. I have that.

00:06:06.192 --> 00:06:06.985
mmh
