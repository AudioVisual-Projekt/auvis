00:01:20.898 --> 00:01:22.812
Yeah, I know. I'm okay.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.188
It's all about... Yeah.

00:01:28.917 --> 00:01:33.912
Yeah, that was good. Wasn't the people's song, the humans' song this good? But it's very good.

00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:40.719
Yes, but it was, it just wasn't that good.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.452
Yeah, but then the mom dies. But then, but then the burning goes to with him.

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:48.559
The burning lesson. Burning Godzilla. That

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:51.462

00:02:04.095 --> 00:02:09.056
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he like he like tore off.

00:02:09.097 --> 00:02:13.434
yeah he tore off a head of the monster and then he dragged the

00:02:13.434 --> 00:02:17.902
I guess , I guess that's kind of like a thing, he has to do it whenever he defeats the monster.

00:02:21.905 --> 00:02:23.420
There was no other monster.

00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:28.982
