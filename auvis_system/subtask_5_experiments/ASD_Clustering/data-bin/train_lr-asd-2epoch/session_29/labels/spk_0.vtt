00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:15.629
I always feel like, OK, now we've got to do suicides. 

00:00:20.674 --> 00:00:25.383
Yeah, where you would like to run and then touch and then run back and

00:00:25.383 --> 00:00:26.968
can touch and....

00:00:28.674 --> 00:00:33.550
I know that kind of sounds like a horrible name for an exercise.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.093
Ha..ha..ha..ha

00:00:37.093 --> 00:00:40.081
That word got cancelled.

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:44.687
Uh huh

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.166
What? What ?

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:06.068
What store is this? Ralph's.

00:01:06.068 --> 00:01:09.376
Oh, sprouts.

00:01:15.332 --> 00:01:18.150
maybe..maybe i

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.010
Some of the customers got a little bit too much like clean eating to their head.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.859
I don't think....

00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:35.617
Wow

00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:48.609
So just like family dynamics and stuff like that.

00:01:49.183 --> 00:01:52.862
I think for me, I always wanted to know what

00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:56.019
(***) we had the same glad but look like

00:01:56.541 --> 00:01:59.697
Like how would I look like physically?

00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:03.898
Oh,

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:08.657
So I think because my dad's blood is so strong.

00:02:08.657 --> 00:02:11.627
His DNA is so strong, like you can tell.

00:02:11.627 --> 00:02:16.403
People would even be like, did your dad give birth to you? 

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:19.205
They say I do.

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:23.153
but like my younger mother it's crazy because um

00:02:23.153 --> 00:02:27.557
My....that on my mom's side, there's me and then my brother.

00:02:27.557 --> 00:02:30.072
like for like we're six years apart

00:02:30.072 --> 00:02:32.636
And then what do we do with me and my youngest brother?

00:02:32.636 --> 00:02:35.270
we are 17 years apart..

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.252
So when I would go take him and my mom would be with us, right?

00:02:39.252 --> 00:02:41.951
They would think she was a grandma and I was the mom.

00:02:41.951 --> 00:02:46.558
And and because both of us were lighter skinned.

00:02:46.558 --> 00:02:50.002
And my brother looks more like my mom.

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:53.596
Even when my mom had me, they were like, are you babysitting? like

00:02:53.596 --> 00:02:56.532
Yeah, they would tell her that so,

00:02:56.532 --> 00:03:00.598
me and my elder brother and youngest brother we don't really look alike but we do..

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.594
were light skinned people and people like okay i see but on my dad's side..

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.473
Yeah, my brother is just sixteen we can tell,

00:03:08.497 --> 00:03:10.977
And then so more so, probably like mom

00:03:13.676 --> 00:03:17.626
So how do you guys match up with your siblings?

00:04:13.093 --> 00:04:15.204
Oh, that's so cool.

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:39.047
I love that. She's like, we're gonna use our words. so much her..

00:04:53.088 --> 00:04:54.774
Are you taller than him?

00:04:55.062 --> 00:05:00.057
just like a (***)

00:05:53.737 --> 00:05:54.749
right

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:01.769
Okay.
