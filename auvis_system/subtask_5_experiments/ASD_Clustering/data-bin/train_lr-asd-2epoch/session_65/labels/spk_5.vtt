WEBVTT

00:00:14.456 --> 00:00:17.697
So, on the topic of (***)

00:00:19.676 --> 00:00:21.175
yeah

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:24.752
yeah

00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:27.171
yeah

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:31.033
yeah

00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:34.993
yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:36.530
Okay, okay. so

00:00:37.623 --> 00:00:39.175
yeah

00:00:40.258 --> 00:00:42.652
yeah yeah

00:00:46.034 --> 00:00:48.953
yeah yeah

00:00:49.978 --> 00:00:51.767
yeah

00:00:52.274 --> 00:00:54.686
Try and dig, try and dig.

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.328
Yeah, try it here.

00:01:02.584 --> 00:01:05.149
yeah yeah yeah

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.655
I was trying to get away on the helicopter but the helicopter always gets destroyed.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:17.081
I don't know, probably because it's the same actor as on all the other characters, like Chibi Ga Ga.

00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:22.058
Yeah, I guess. That's probably one of them. But yeah, that's good.

00:01:25.026 --> 00:01:26.762
yeah

00:01:29.814 --> 00:01:31.786
yeah

00:01:33.888 --> 00:01:35.576
yeah yeah yeah

00:01:36.642 --> 00:01:38.904
yeah

00:01:44.147 --> 00:01:46.645
Well, actually I haven't really seen...

00:01:46.645 --> 00:01:51.641
personality that much because we didn't watch the part of the actual people talking.

00:01:51.641 --> 00:01:53.649
Yeah, i (***) I know

00:01:54.593 --> 00:01:59.504
But I remember a lot of the small gals came out, remember?

00:02:03.353 --> 00:02:04.799
yeah

00:02:06.034 --> 00:02:08.650
Oh yeah, all the little ones came up, remember?

00:02:10.466 --> 00:02:11.886
yeah

00:02:11.947 --> 00:02:16.942
but then gamera will come in and just squish all of it

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:19.534
Like a little book.

00:02:22.181 --> 00:02:24.022
yeah

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:29.326
yeah

00:02:29.727 --> 00:02:31.532
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:35.787 --> 00:02:37.497
yeah

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.205
yeah yeah

00:02:41.438 --> 00:02:44.628
Well, I guess he just tries to predict people in general.

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:47.887
yeah

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:51.007
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:51.007 --> 00:02:55.715
I don't know. I can tell depending on how the director went.

00:02:56.896 --> 00:03:01.554
I don't know, maybe the director of the film or maybe Wanda? like

00:03:03.493 --> 00:03:06.278
I guess.

00:03:09.603 --> 00:03:12.489
Or maybe, but yeah. 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.894
yeah

00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:21.972
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:25.032 --> 00:03:27.793
yeah yeah

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:33.092
yeah yeah

00:03:33.598 --> 00:03:35.556
Yeah, yeah

00:03:40.213 --> 00:03:41.497
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:03:44.572 --> 00:03:46.676
(***)

00:03:49.102 --> 00:03:51.206
yeah

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:58.912
oh yeah yeah all the kids are passing and  oh that was good

00:03:58.912 --> 00:04:00.532
yeah

00:04:03.568 --> 00:04:07.704
Who came out? Which one?

00:04:09.373 --> 00:04:12.748
I don't know. I guess it kind of does.

00:04:12.748 --> 00:04:15.264
I kind of like the kid who...

00:04:15.264 --> 00:04:20.259
comes out when the baby gamera comes out.

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.468
Yeah.

00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:25.411
yeah

00:04:27.174 --> 00:04:28.568
yeah

00:04:29.927 --> 00:04:30.451
(***)

00:04:31.514 --> 00:04:36.273
What? No, no, no, the boy.

00:04:36.543 --> 00:04:39.310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.663
But who's your favorite? Which is your favorite?

00:04:43.663 --> 00:04:46.634
Cameraman, Villain, Monster.

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:50.664
yeah i guess

00:04:51.476 --> 00:04:54.819
yeah yeah yeah

00:04:56.041 --> 00:04:57.465
yeah

00:04:58.483 --> 00:05:00.042
yeah

00:05:03.614 --> 00:05:07.614
yeah yeah

00:05:10.156 --> 00:05:11.647
yeah

00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:14.951
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:16.496 --> 00:05:18.168
yeah

00:05:19.342 --> 00:05:20.947
yeah

00:05:21.648 --> 00:05:23.659
yeah

00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:28.569
yeah  yeah  yeah so everyone like kind of like passes and then

00:05:31.004 --> 00:05:32.902
yeah

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:38.389
yeah In the end, one of the kids that they passed along to ran into the two boys who were

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.971
They're supposed to go to evacuation but they got lost.

00:05:40.971 --> 00:05:44.026
Yeah, somehow,

00:05:44.026 --> 00:05:47.958
they got into that.

00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:52.766
Yeah, and that's what they did.

00:05:53.863 --> 00:05:58.858
Yeah, so he went so he he went up and

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:01.576
gave the stone to Gamera

00:06:01.576 --> 00:06:05.576
yeah yeah and then that's basically

00:06:06.802 --> 00:06:09.401
yeah yeah

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:14.536
Yeah, yeah
