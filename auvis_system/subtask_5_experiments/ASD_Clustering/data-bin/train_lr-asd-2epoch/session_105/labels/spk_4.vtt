00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.497
The one that comes to mind is a Japanese drama. It's not a movie, but it's like...

00:00:26.497 --> 00:00:30.159

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:34.663

And then buys a house a little bit further away from the city.

00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:58.559
And then the house that she buys is actually...

Retirement age, so they have to live together, like in the same house.

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:14.675
