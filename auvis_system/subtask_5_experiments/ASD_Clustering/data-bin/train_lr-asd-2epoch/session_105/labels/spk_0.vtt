WEBVTT

00:00:11.947 --> 00:00:14.421
Hmm...

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:19.543
Hmm... They're all short and ...

00:00:19.543 --> 00:00:24.199
Big and hairy and lusty and don't want that kind of stuff... ha.. ha.. ha.. 

00:00:30.156 --> 00:00:34.781
Ah.. hung...  Ah.. hung...

00:00:34.781 --> 00:00:37.311
that I love, I really like this.

00:00:40.928 --> 00:00:42.504
Hmm...

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:47.301
Oh, bard. Yeah.

00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:50.913
I think I really like what they did with him. He made him like a

00:00:50.913 --> 00:00:54.828
a father because in the book he's nothing like that he's just

00:00:54.828 --> 00:00:58.575
a guy who shows up. He's kind of more like out of one.

00:00:58.575 --> 00:01:02.539
but older and like not as like

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:06.346
Not as noble like without the kingship

00:01:06.303 --> 00:01:09.053
So the movie they meet him.

00:01:09.053 --> 00:01:14.048
A father who's a well-respected, really good person.

00:01:14.048 --> 00:01:16.091
Yedah...

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:20.615
No.. for that... yeah...

00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:25.524
Yeah, because he's just....

00:01:25.524 --> 00:01:28.038
Yeah....

00:01:28.038 --> 00:01:30.553
Yeah...  And then the people respected, loved him.

00:01:30.553 --> 00:01:34.333
Give them the support that they want and they can't get.

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:39.327
Yeah... yeah...  yedah...  yeah... 

00:01:39.327 --> 00:01:42.146
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:42.146 --> 00:01:46.466
Yeah, yeah, yeah

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.182
Oh no.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.747
Yeah...  yeah...

00:01:55.747 --> 00:02:00.690
(***)   He was the leader of the common folk.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.500
But then he kind of has a weakness too because

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.554
he's like after yeah like

00:02:08.576 --> 00:02:12.069
Well i'm not i don't know if it's a weakness actually

00:02:12.047 --> 00:02:16.722
He was kinda pushed to it, but he does agree to attack the dwarves with the elves.

00:02:16.722 --> 00:02:20.823
Even though he tried to reason with them first.

00:02:20.823 --> 00:02:23.338
But then he kind of gives in to like

00:02:23.338 --> 00:02:26.914
like being willing to spill blood to get the gold.

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:29.565
So it kind of falls into that.

00:02:29.565 --> 00:02:32.079
but he never wanted to kill them though

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.807
Hope they.. like..yeah.. yeah...

00:02:35.808 --> 00:02:40.162

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.024
Yeah...   yeah... I think I really like

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.878
What they do with how he kills the dragon

00:03:03.922 --> 00:03:08.781
It's on the shoulder of his son.

00:03:08.781 --> 00:03:13.726
Yeah, it is. (***)

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.764
I know so everyday like  (***) change for

00:03:22.247 --> 00:03:27.243
Yeah...  A lot more dramatic. It's a lot more emotionally connecting and driving.

00:03:27.243 --> 00:03:28.239
Yeah...

00:03:28.265 --> 00:03:31.483

Yeah...   yeah...

00:03:48.825 --> 00:03:53.264
It's a forbidden love in a way

00:03:53.286 --> 00:03:57.639
Yeah. Yeah...   Yeah...

00:03:57.618 --> 00:04:01.009
Yeah..   and then know like...

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:04.705
And everyone knows that's words that I was still waiting for.

00:04:04.705 --> 00:04:08.299
So it adds a different spice to it.

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.294

Ha... ha... ha... ha... ha...  

00:04:21.058 --> 00:04:24.635
Yeah.. And that's another thing they did not have in the book... so..

00:04:24.656 --> 00:04:28.537
Yeah....  Notario doesn't exist. You know....

00:04:28.494 --> 00:04:32.072
Okay... Yeah.,...Yeah... So...

00:04:36.313 --> 00:04:41.138
We have the last verb, but then she doesn't like him back. And then he lets that go.

00:04:41.138 --> 00:04:45.054
So..Yeah, ..Yeah...

00:04:45.054 --> 00:04:47.568

Yeah...  But that he was he wanted to still protect and defend her

00:05:01.624 --> 00:05:05.523
to the last. And he was so mad when he...

00:05:05.523 --> 00:05:10.518
Really? When the orc hurt her. And he went all the way and killed the orc.

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:14.213
