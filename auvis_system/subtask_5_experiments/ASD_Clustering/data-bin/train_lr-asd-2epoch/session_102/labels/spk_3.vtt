WEBVTT

00:00:06.758 --> 00:00:08.036
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:17.553
Okay, camera on.

00:00:19.493 --> 00:00:21.100
Okay, so.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.530
Before we do any of that, of talking about Jesus to them...

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.900
Our focus is get to know them, become friends with them.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.899
and spend time with them. So...

00:00:34.627 --> 00:00:39.524
Um... For the most part, they know we're coming from the Christian background. They already know that.

00:00:39.524 --> 00:00:44.151
So for them to kind of agree to meet us or hang out with us.

00:00:44.192 --> 00:00:48.944
They know that uh... in the word Christian, we're not hiding you know anything like

00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:49.940
Um...

00:00:50.886 --> 00:00:53.017
Yeah open door you can come in.

00:00:53.057 --> 00:00:57.938
Um... and often whenever we do some games activities together kind of thing,

00:00:57.817 --> 00:01:00.128
or before meal we pray, right?

00:01:00.128 --> 00:01:04.634
So they not, they were kind of exposed to that, which they probably never had in the past.

00:01:04.634 --> 00:01:07.915
But they don't say anything about that, but

00:01:08.562 --> 00:01:12.684
So after we start developing relationships with them,

00:01:12.684 --> 00:01:17.291
So, I don't know. Depends on, depends on the um...

00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.375
Uh...

00:01:18.994 --> 00:01:21.331
situation but I

00:01:21.735 --> 00:01:24.925
You know, I'm, I'm not hiding anything, so I kinda like

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:28.800
from my Christian perspective, you know, we'll talk about this and that.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.414
um... And I to say, did you guys...

00:01:31.414 --> 00:01:35.160
So in, in a regular conversation, I just...

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.759
My way. Oh, you know.

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.815
I believe in this and the Bible says this and stuff.

00:01:40.815 --> 00:01:44.645
Nothing to kind of go against them, but introduce how I think.

00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:47.261
about certain things, you know.

00:01:47.261 --> 00:01:50.247
And they're pretty open to hear that, hear that and...

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.440
Um...

00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:56.389
So this, first so they came in like this group that we're hanging out with

00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:01.065
They, they came around September or mid- late August

00:02:01.065 --> 00:02:05.485
right? and then... we already kind of connected with them because um...

00:02:06.416 --> 00:02:10.116
We have a student who came from last year.

00:02:10.277 --> 00:02:15.758
Introduced some of the new students to us prior to them coming to the U.S.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.828
Over zoom

00:02:17.788 --> 00:02:21.770
or actually we have a group of a um... missionaries in Osaka.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.995
because they're from Osaka area too. That's school that we're kind of engaging with.

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:30.730
Um... they, some of them already met the missionaries from Osaka.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.155
Because these previous students...um

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:38.240
who was home staying with the Christian families. We, we know them.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.235
So that's two students introduce some of the new students that have come over.

00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:47.825
to the missionary that, who's who's doing the ministry in Japan.

00:02:47.825 --> 00:02:50.339
in Osaka. So they, they met.

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:53.866
And then they've been told, oh, there are people like us.

00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:57.494
in Long Beach, so you should connect with them.

00:02:57.494 --> 00:03:01.646
Alright. So, we've been doing this for a long time, too. That's one of the things.

00:03:01.646 --> 00:03:05.357
We're maybe uh... 20 years we're doing this, right? so...

00:03:06.126 --> 00:03:09.441
So it's it's pretty. So we have kind of network

00:03:09.441 --> 00:03:12.867
Oh. um... system thing going on here.

00:03:12.867 --> 00:03:16.022
But, so by the time they come, they know we're Christians.

00:03:16.022 --> 00:03:19.290
We're not hiding anything like that, and then...

00:03:19.775 --> 00:03:24.892
As we get to know who they are. We, we let them know who we are.

00:03:24.892 --> 00:03:28.038
and then just in a more natural way we start to talk about

00:03:28.038 --> 00:03:31.159
the Bible. And we start talking about, you know

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:36.600
When the time is right, I introd... I talk about you know, what the Bible belief.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.159
Sometimes they do ask me, like, what is the Bible? What, what does that mean?

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:44.694
And, who is Jesus kind of thing. And I

00:03:44.694 --> 00:03:47.207
of course I'll let them know who is behind it.

00:03:47.207 --> 00:03:51.191
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Question. Yeah.

00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:54.633
Also I, I need to feel them

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:59.668
I don't do a kind of cold turkey evangelism or anything like that. Uh...

00:04:00.315 --> 00:04:02.503
Because naturally it come

00:04:02.462 --> 00:04:05.467
in our conversation. And uh...

00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:09.617
because my whole purpose is get to know them. I want to be the support.

00:04:09.617 --> 00:04:12.521
And I wanted to be their friend. And

00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:16.189
let's spend time the difficult part is

00:04:16.513 --> 00:04:19.578
Scheduling my time with them. Because

00:04:20.265 --> 00:04:25.260
you know, um right now I only have time on weekends. And

00:04:25.584 --> 00:04:30.090
Usually Wednesdays, like tonight? I usually use this to hang out with the...

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.918
uh... with the students at night because I work till five o'clock, right?

00:04:33.918 --> 00:04:39.169
I come back, I go out there and pick them up and have some coffee or something like that.

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:43.097
And I hang, I tried to hang out with them on during the week.

00:04:45.984 --> 00:04:50.489
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And because they have no car, they can't really go anywhere else. So,

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:53.577
I picked them up. Go to the... kind of nice.

00:04:53.577 --> 00:04:56.614
coffee shop kind of thing that they don't usually go to.

00:04:56.614 --> 00:05:01.609
So we kind of hang out there and talk about what's going on and stuff like that. So,

00:05:01.609 --> 00:05:04.512
and of course I'm a lot older than they are because

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:08.106
their age, their parents are the same age as me.

00:05:07.945 --> 00:05:11.448
You know, my my daughter is same age as them.

00:05:12.055 --> 00:05:17.253
So, so it's been. So, yeah, so things have changed in my life

00:05:17.253 --> 00:05:21.724
So I'm like, oh, I'm their parent's age now, you know. But

00:05:21.724 --> 00:05:24.779
But yeah, it seems pretty cool. They're pretty open

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:25.969
Um...

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.010
Actually, I do have one of the students who's already a believer.

00:05:30.213 --> 00:05:32.437
yeah he became a believer

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.248
uh... last year uh... through

00:05:35.207 --> 00:05:38.870
you know Christian ministry that he was kind of involved in

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.224
uh so i bring him on with me and then so that

00:05:43.224 --> 00:05:46.346
He's still a baby Christian so...

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:49.399
I'm hoping that I'm being a model for this.

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:53.837
this guide to how to talk about Christianity or Jesus to

00:05:53.837 --> 00:05:58.698
other Japanese because you know I think he needs to get the exposure.

00:05:58.698 --> 00:06:03.693
So I'm trying to be the... might be to model him. Model for him.

00:06:03.693 --> 00:06:04.739
And things like that.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:05.549
Yeah. 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:14.527
That's the whole goal yeah so we're trying to make them um...

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:19.022
So when they are returning, we were making sure that we had,

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:20.054
they they already...

00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:20.901
Oh.
