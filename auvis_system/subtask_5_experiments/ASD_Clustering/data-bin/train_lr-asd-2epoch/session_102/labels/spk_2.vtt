one that they usually use like the kind of more like youngsters usually use.

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.942
Okay, we can start Star Wars.

Mystery kind.

00:04:34.742 --> 00:04:37.711
Historical fiction in real life.

00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:40.944
Yeah. Yeah. That's good.

00:04:41.266 --> 00:04:47.068
I think our homeschool program um, make this grid of a lot of historical fiction.

00:04:46.988 --> 00:04:50.182
That... yeah. Yeah....

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.805
Yeah, I think that's your theme, right? Yeah, yeah.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.196
Yeah, yeah. You're like reading until like 2 in the morning.

00:05:11.083 --> 00:05:12.423
That's all he wants.

00:05:18.157 --> 00:05:18.956

00:05:20.428 --> 00:05:21.235
Yeah. 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.843
I think for me

00:05:24.843 --> 00:05:30.282
recently I read like a fantasy like duology.

00:05:30.242 --> 00:05:34.663
It's like an adaptation of Peter Pan. It's like by a Christian author.

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:39.537
So I was like, okay, I want to check it out. So it was pretty interesting

00:05:39.602 --> 00:05:40.368
Yeah. 

00:05:41.151 --> 00:05:43.543
I think the message though really got to me

00:05:45.841 --> 00:05:49.413
The message of those book. It's like the importance of growing up.

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:53.524
I think, because Peter Pan though... so, yeah, yeah. So like

00:05:53.524 --> 00:05:58.519
He runs into really serious dilemmas because he can't grow up. Yeah.

00:05:58.842 --> 00:05:59.944
Yeah.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.455
No. It's okay. Yeah.
