WEBVTT

00:00:11.487 --> 00:00:12.564
Okay.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.162
Yup.

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:20.797
Okay.

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:23.708
Yeah. 

00:00:41.356 --> 00:00:43.191
I don't know, like...

00:00:49.905 --> 00:00:51.987
I don't think so.

00:00:57.582 --> 00:01:01.153
Yeah, they created a whole new language, yeah.

00:01:01.165 --> 00:01:02.181
Yeah. 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.238
No, no, no. Just a language, but I think

00:01:08.238 --> 00:01:13.063
like in my mind i think lord of the rings kind of set off that trend.

00:01:13.998 --> 00:01:18.428
Like language for like yeah, the purpose of a movie.

00:01:22.513 --> 00:01:25.566
Does Star Wars have a different language? 

00:01:30.354 --> 00:01:31.045
Yeah. 

00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:34.746
Yeah. 

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:40.790
What's your favorite Star- oh, can we just veer off onto Star Wars?

00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:44.606
Because I'm not, I don't know much about Star Wars. So I'm gonna...

00:01:45.947 --> 00:01:49.192
Which one do you like the most out of all...

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:52.685
Okay, first let's go with the trilogy. The first one.

00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:54.496
Which one do you like? 

00:01:56.214 --> 00:01:57.067
Five?

00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:02.423
What do you like? Four? The original one.

00:02:02.423 --> 00:02:05.129
And Ellie likes the second one.

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.393
Really?

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:18.831
Oh. Okay.

00:02:27.504 --> 00:02:31.092
But see, I. when I read Lord uh Lord of the Rings,

00:02:31.052 --> 00:02:34.115
I did not really care much for the fellowship in the ring.

00:02:34.115 --> 00:02:37.334
I just was reading it.

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:41.067
Because like... I

00:02:41.067 --> 00:02:45.808
I never really cared to read the Lord of The Rings originally.

00:02:45.808 --> 00:02:50.094
But um, when that movie came out,

00:02:50.094 --> 00:02:52.693
there was a whole campaign for

00:02:52.693 --> 00:02:57.688
uh... people to get kids, the next generation of kids to read.

00:02:57.688 --> 00:03:02.683
So um... some like educational grant people said

00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:04.876
if the kids read...

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:07.931
and write a report on it.

00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:11.897
They will get free tickets to go to the movie and then the

00:03:11.897 --> 00:03:15.794
District in Taipei would fund the bus

00:03:15.997 --> 00:03:19.592
trip to go watch the movie during the day.

00:03:19.592 --> 00:03:24.570
And so when that happened, my kids hated reading.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.762
So I said okay I'll read,

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:32.310
and you guys will then have to read too, to get the kids to read.

00:03:33.042 --> 00:03:35.865
And hit to paying for. Yeah.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.648
forever

00:03:39.924 --> 00:03:43.224
Me too because I couldn't get into it

00:03:43.183 --> 00:03:44.588
at first...

00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:46.542
the...

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.867
I think it's setting up the stage.

00:03:50.785 --> 00:03:53.730
That it was so slow.

00:04:08.772 --> 00:04:09.627
mmh.

00:04:09.627 --> 00:04:12.513
I'm curious, what book do you? What book

00:04:13.122 --> 00:04:15.367
What books do you like?

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:21.271
Mystery type... in the end.

00:04:26.588 --> 00:04:27.523
Yeah. 

00:04:31.226 --> 00:04:32.662
Mystery.

00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:39.377
Historical fiction. Mmh, Nice. Yeah.

00:04:46.668 --> 00:04:52.394
Yeah, it was good. What historical fiction did you like so far?

00:05:05.516 --> 00:05:06.839
Good books?

00:05:12.216 --> 00:05:13.363
Wow.

00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:23.953

00:05:30.894 --> 00:05:31.748
Oh.

00:05:35.083 --> 00:05:36.255
Okay.

00:05:39.654 --> 00:05:40.740

00:05:43.705 --> 00:05:44.314
mmh

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.108
Depends how you use to grow up.

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:57.098
Yeah.

00:05:57.971 --> 00:05:58.784
mmh

00:06:00.918 --> 00:06:03.213
Oh yeah, sorry. How did you?

00:06:08.382 --> 00:06:09.317

Samwise.
