00:00:14.591 --> 00:00:16.971
Ooh. Where were we?

00:00:19.113 --> 00:00:20.615
Oh, Images.

00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:26.640
Huh.

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:38.993
I know.

00:00:41.506 --> 00:00:44.155
I mean, I think for classical music...

00:00:44.155 --> 00:00:47.564
Like programmatic music is a good word to start.

00:00:47.604 --> 00:00:50.996
Because it's very um... explicit in the

00:00:50.957 --> 00:00:55.698
like the characters like the characters are like X like times 10

00:00:55.698 --> 00:01:00.692
Because I guess programmatic music is like music that's...

00:01:00.692 --> 00:01:05.689
takes a story and represents that story in the music so

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.210
If you know the story Don Quixote? Don Quixote, you know?

00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:14.391
Cervantes. there's a guy named Strauss, who

00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:19.053
composed his, we call it Tome Poems of

00:01:19.053 --> 00:01:23.913
Don Quixote. And that piece is pretty cool because you can hear um...

00:01:23.913 --> 00:01:26.463
there's a scene, there's a part in the book

00:01:26.463 --> 00:01:32.250
Cervantes. There, the crazy night, Don Quixote. Do you know Don Quixote?

00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:38.189
He's like, he's like the knight who goes crazy because he read too much shibbo

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.903
shibboleth novels. He thinks he's a knight, but he's not.

00:01:41.903 --> 00:01:44.484
And so like he like kills a flock of sheep.

00:01:44.484 --> 00:01:47.252
because he thought it was like warriors.

00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:51.353
And he's like, I just like won the battle, but like there's a

00:01:51.353 --> 00:01:55.722
Dead flock of sheep and so you can in that

00:01:55.722 --> 00:01:58.237
Strauss' Don Quixote, you can hear...

00:01:58.237 --> 00:02:03.198
There's like sheep like bleeding and dying and sheep sounds.

00:02:03.198 --> 00:02:04.442
and like... Yeah.

00:02:06.034 --> 00:02:09.599
Don Quixote. It's called Don Quixote Strauss. Yeah.

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:15.027
Yes! Don Quixote!

00:02:15.027 --> 00:02:20.007
Yes. Dodonkey, donkey. Donkey, dodon.

00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:24.057
That's a good place.

00:02:26.143 --> 00:02:28.524
Yeah, the story came from the store.

00:02:29.021 --> 00:02:29.965
Yeah. 

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:04.608
Oh.

00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:47.486
Yeah.

00:03:52.515 --> 00:03:53.420
Yeah. 

00:03:57.963 --> 00:03:58.829
Yeah. 

00:04:09.896 --> 00:04:12.158
Yes.... Wait.

00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:29.161
Yawn.

00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:31.793
sheep.
