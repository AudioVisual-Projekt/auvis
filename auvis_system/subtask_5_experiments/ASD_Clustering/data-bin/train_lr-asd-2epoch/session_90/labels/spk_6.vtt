00:00:16.673 --> 00:00:20.127
Mariachi images, imagery.

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:27.630
Ooh.

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:37.390
Oh my gosh. Damn. Gonna marinate on that for that a while,

00:00:38.937 --> 00:00:39.721
mmh

00:01:02.086 --> 00:01:03.184
mmh

00:01:08.522 --> 00:01:09.149
mmh

00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:11.046
mmh

00:01:27.183 --> 00:01:27.888
mmh

00:01:32.303 --> 00:01:35.491
I heard about the, like the novel, yeah.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.778
mmh

00:01:52.952 --> 00:01:53.736
Oh.

00:02:00.974 --> 00:02:01.719
mmh

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.634
Which, which piece by Strauss? Oh, Don Quixote, okay.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.223
Do you have something?

00:02:47.277 --> 00:02:48.375
mmh

00:02:53.805 --> 00:02:54.864
Uh-mmh

00:03:01.137 --> 00:03:02.038
Ooh.

00:03:07.371 --> 00:03:08.469
Wow.

00:03:20.502 --> 00:03:21.443
Wow.

00:03:45.411 --> 00:03:46.391
mmh

00:03:54.037 --> 00:03:58.287
Oh... There's no in-between. Oh! Wow.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.384
I think like first thing that popped off in my head is this song

00:04:03.384 --> 00:04:06.034
I don't know if it's by hillsong.

00:04:06.034 --> 00:04:10.708
But it's I think it's called a hundred billion times and 

00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:15.804
I don't like the way they put the lyric in at the ballgame.

00:04:15.804 --> 00:04:18.977
because you know everything was created but

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.803
there's this part in the song where it talks about like

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.151
on a hill you created, you know, like you went there to die like

00:04:28.503 --> 00:04:29.163
I

00:04:30.114 --> 00:04:35.025
That's such a powerful thing for to like to have in a song like 

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:38.620
And it makes it kind of took me back to like wall like 

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:41.352
Did all of this, created all of this.

00:04:41.313 --> 00:04:44.288
to come and die for us like all of this was crap

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.895
So that really hit me hard and every time I'd hear that song I'd be... you know?

00:04:48.895 --> 00:04:52.338
um... But that would probably be the one that stuck out.

00:04:58.436 --> 00:04:59.220
mmh

00:05:23.067 --> 00:05:23.694
mmh

00:05:24.288 --> 00:05:25.307
Uh-hmm

00:05:29.463 --> 00:05:34.189
That song when it first came out is when I decided

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:37.934
to leave my career in Arizona and 

00:05:37.934 --> 00:05:41.816
move to California for the first time. And

00:05:41.816 --> 00:05:45.427
I was scared because you're only leaving your safety and your comfort.

00:05:45.427 --> 00:05:50.119
to go do something unknown. So that was a very like theme of my life as a missionary.

00:05:50.422 --> 00:05:54.108
Right? So that's one that really resonates too.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.842
and they even play it I think they even played it like in secular stations or like

00:05:58.842 --> 00:06:02.859
i heard it like you know like it would be like in the station where they 

00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:07.179
put like the cool music not like pop but like

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:10.862
You know, stuff that you hear from like the 90s.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.218
the 80's world like...
