WEBVTT

00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:16.293
All right. Um... Mariachi.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.620
Yeah.

00:00:19.696 --> 00:00:23.763
Let's talk about um... like a song that you could recommend to anybody.

00:00:23.763 --> 00:00:27.306
like your favorite song that you want somebody to listen to.

00:00:27.228 --> 00:00:32.268
and then what about what about that song is like what do you want people to hear

00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:33.815
Yeah.

00:00:38.646 --> 00:00:41.094
Do you have anything off the top of your head?

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:56.170
mmh

00:01:09.032 --> 00:01:09.819
mmh

00:01:09.832 --> 00:01:11.142
Cervantes.

00:02:02.025 --> 00:02:06.025
Oh wow, really? Okay, I I haven't really heard...

00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:10.750
Don Quixote. That's interesting.

00:02:16.387 --> 00:02:21.382
It's, yes. Donkey Donkey Donkey hotel.

00:02:22.917 --> 00:02:26.067
So funny. Yes, you're right.

00:02:29.988 --> 00:02:34.189
How about you, Josiah? Do you have any songs or anything that you would recommend?

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.467
like one of your favorites that you want people to hear.

00:02:40.028 --> 00:02:41.732
You're not ready yet, okay.

00:02:42.677 --> 00:02:46.931
I do, actually. Um... Mozart's Ave Verum Corpus.

00:02:47.718 --> 00:02:50.176
yeah it's one of like the most

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.540
It's so, so we were talking about pure sounds, right? It's like...

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.510
that incarnate, like it's just amazing.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.480
And I heard it when I was in Vienna.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.189
and the Vienna Boys Choir was singing it.

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.526
And then the Vienna Phil, led by Muti, was um...

00:03:09.526 --> 00:03:13.441
was performing it and it was just like heaven on earth like

00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:17.846
I've never really cried like because something was so beautiful but that song is like 

00:03:17.846 --> 00:03:20.360
the first time like I was able to shed a tear.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.717
It was so beautiful. And like there's this

00:03:23.717 --> 00:03:26.468
the way the sounds just kind of...

00:03:26.468 --> 00:03:29.151
like C major resonates.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:34.349
it's just it was so pure like it's literally so pure so that one i always

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.703
Recommend people listen to but it's hard because like

00:03:38.703 --> 00:03:42.314
you can't really like

00:03:42.314 --> 00:03:45.925
I think the children singing it made it that way.

00:03:45.886 --> 00:03:48.665
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:03:48.626 --> 00:03:52.236
So like if you do it a little bit wrong, it's just not good.

00:03:52.236 --> 00:03:57.378
It's like perfect or not. Yeah. It's like one of those song there's no in between.

00:03:57.338 --> 00:03:59.481
Yeah. Yeah. How about you?

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:10.108
mmh

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:25.636
mmh

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:28.297
mmh

00:04:31.752 --> 00:04:32.382
mmh

00:04:41.028 --> 00:04:42.052
uh-hmm

00:04:42.645 --> 00:04:43.550
mmh

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.028
mmh

00:04:51.045 --> 00:04:55.738
Very nice. I really love like this is like we're going off the

00:04:55.738 --> 00:04:58.740
the worship thing but oceans

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.694
I thought the lyrics like I

00:05:01.694 --> 00:05:04.512
You call me on until the waters

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:08.444
And then you're like challenge me to always like go further.

00:05:08.444 --> 00:05:12.004
and then let... what what's the chorus?

00:05:12.004 --> 00:05:15.386
Jesus, lead me where my heart can...

00:05:15.943 --> 00:05:18.187
lead me in the heart

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:24.880
It's like when where I am forced to like look to your name or something like that.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.466
And I that really like kind of spoke to me when that first when I first sang that song.

00:05:31.454 --> 00:05:32.202
mmh

00:05:38.998 --> 00:05:39.864
mmh

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.316
I know.

00:05:48.786 --> 00:05:49.652
mmh

00:05:50.303 --> 00:05:50.972
mmh

00:05:53.067 --> 00:05:54.906
I sing losing.

00:05:58.985 --> 00:06:00.656
Do they really?

00:06:06.264 --> 00:06:07.253
Yeah. 

00:06:07.554 --> 00:06:08.342
like?

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:11.169
mmh
