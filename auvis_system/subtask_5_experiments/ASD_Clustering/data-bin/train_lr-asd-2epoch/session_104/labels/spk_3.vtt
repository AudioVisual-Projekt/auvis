And some is like one is happily married one is

00:04:11.065 --> 00:04:16.061
a divorce say one is just a big blur.

00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:19.757
And then one is like, just lost her husband.

00:04:19.757 --> 00:04:23.569
And it's just their home and finding new love.

00:04:23.592 --> 00:04:27.963
In the past, you never really...

00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:30.454

I haven't gone to movies lately. I don't enjoy the movies.

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:59.605
in the last 10 years. I feel like there's no originality.

00:05:59.605 --> 00:06:04.516
It's like, I'm sorry, it all seems like Marvel.

00:06:04.516 --> 00:06:07.571
Marvel. And ...

00:06:08.853 --> 00:06:12.954
Sorry   It's just like I don't see the movies.
