WEBVTT

00:00:11.148 --> 00:00:16.125
Okay, so we were talking about vegan, low glass , and it seemed to be working.

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:18.960
Well, I think. Oh, I know.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.474
when he mentioned

00:00:21.564 --> 00:00:23.561
To arm

00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:28.613
When he saw the pictures of the eyebrows.(***)

00:00:28.613 --> 00:00:31.584
Yeah, game of these. Yeah, yeah.. yeah..

00:00:31.584 --> 00:00:34.284
Yeah..  yeah so that kind of little humor

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:39.279
it's kind of inside joke almost if you don't see the lord of the rings you don't you might not know

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:41.371
but that kind of thing.

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:47.514
Yeah he was oh no(***)

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:51.699
Saint, you know, nothing can defeat him

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.718
He'll never die. He's always strong.

00:00:54.718 --> 00:00:58.398
But he's royal, you know, he's a very serious character.

00:00:58.398 --> 00:01:03.088
but this one he is serious too but he gives little little

00:01:03.088 --> 00:01:07.105
first like not a joke but Ohhhhhhh....

00:01:11.763 --> 00:01:13.653
Maybe. Maybe.

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.656
Yeah... That's true...

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.519
And then the dwarves, the characters themselves are quirky. Everybody is quirky.

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:31.540
Ha.. ha...so so the characters

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:39.583
Yeah... yeah...

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:49.916
That makes sense, because of that.

00:01:49.961 --> 00:01:54.956
That 13 doors have so many so much characters each one of them

00:01:54.912 --> 00:01:59.079
And other..Yeah, yeah... yeah...

00:02:03.552 --> 00:02:06.185
yeah yeah yeah..different groups

00:02:07.484 --> 00:02:09.576
Yeah... yeah..

00:02:10.953 --> 00:02:12.483
Yeah...

00:02:12.596 --> 00:02:17.591
True...   Even though they are 13, each one has a difference.

00:02:17.547 --> 00:02:22.542
Personalities, but they all are like dwarfs.

00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:25.146
Yeah...So they have to be endorsed by me.

00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:30.096
It's the worst and they did it really good.. yeah..

00:02:30.096 --> 00:02:35.091
yeah so which is which which dwarf do you like the best (***)

00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:35.581
What's that?

00:02:47.494 --> 00:02:48.675
Oh, okay, okay.

00:02:51.544 --> 00:02:52.540
Who's balding?

00:02:54.785 --> 00:02:57.804
Oh, okay, okay. Oh, that's fine.

00:02:57.804 --> 00:03:02.649
he's a good guy yeah he's realist manything

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:05.601
But he gives up things really easily too.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.620
Ha, ha, ha...    Yeah...

00:03:11.873 --> 00:03:14.290
Yeah...

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.420
Uh..  Hmm...

00:03:18.475 --> 00:03:20.250
Yeah...  yedah...

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.399

00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:27.471
Group for...  group

00:03:27.471 --> 00:03:32.466
Powfer...   Powfer is the murder..

00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:32.601

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:34.596

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.038
yeah yeah he's the one that who gives the handkerchief

00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:44.514
to get one piece of (***)

00:03:44.514 --> 00:03:49.510
piece piece of piece of i don't know what that it was (***)

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.869
And it was like all smelly. and...

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:55.434
Wet...   yeah...

00:03:55.434 --> 00:03:59.871
I thought about..   I like that out of all the dwarves, I like fandom.

00:03:59.871 --> 00:04:02.655
(***)  He's kind.

00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:05.547
And he is very he knows where he..  I mean...

00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:10.587
he knows his position but he's also 

00:04:10.587 --> 00:04:15.177
Yeah, big brother, but he's also kinda...

00:04:15.177 --> 00:04:19.717
impulsive, like he's the one who gets up at the last one to get up.

00:04:19.717 --> 00:04:22.230
when everybody already went to the misty mountain.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.225
he got up he wasn't like he was sick or anything he just overslept

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:31.494
Ha... ha.. ha.. I thought that was funny.

00:04:31.494 --> 00:04:36.489
And he just gets up and hit himself in the table.

00:04:36.489 --> 00:04:41.484
yeah yeah he drinks and then he goes so he's gullible

00:04:41.484 --> 00:04:43.864
I thought that was fun.

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:46.446
Hmm..... Yeah...

00:04:48.974 --> 00:04:51.436
Ahh... hung....

00:04:54.766 --> 00:04:57.263
Yeah, yeah... yeah...

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:59.794
Ha... ha... ha... And I think they know.

00:04:59.794 --> 00:05:03.609
But that is true, everyone has a quirkiness or a...

00:05:03.609 --> 00:05:06.595
their own personality that none others have.

00:05:06.595 --> 00:05:11.590
but at the same time they are dwarfs, you know, so they have the commonality.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.196
Of course, not just the height and how thick they are, they're all...

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:20.607
Short and thick. And then they're all hairy.. Yeah...

00:05:20.607 --> 00:05:22.041
But...

00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:27.217
Everybody have a long hair and long beard or you know things like that but

00:05:27.217 --> 00:05:27.369
Oh my god.

00:05:28.854 --> 00:05:33.460
They're very hard-headed. Everyone is hard-headed.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.999
 They're greedy. Everyone is greedy... like

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:41.662
They don't want to pay when they say, come pay up, pay up, and no one wants to pay.

00:05:41.662 --> 00:05:44.968
They love money and they love meat.

00:05:44.968 --> 00:05:47.669
and they hate (***)

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.009
They have, yeah. They don't like elves.

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:56.004
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So those are the things.

00:05:56.004 --> 00:05:59.684
And they they tend to be

00:05:59.684 --> 00:06:04.460
act strong one when they're even though they're scared to death yeah

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.480
Ah huh .. likes... everybody

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.172
