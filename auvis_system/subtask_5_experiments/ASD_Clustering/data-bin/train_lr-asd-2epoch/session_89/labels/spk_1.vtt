But there's salmon too. I think, I think.

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:54.227
It depends on what kind it is.

Yeah, yeah. That's right, that's right. Salmon. Yeah. Okay.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.220
That's true. So actually, you're right. I ordered salmon first. Yeah.

00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:14.832
Okay. The first time I tried salmon, I almost threw up. Just saying. Like raw, raw.

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:18.441
because I hadn't been used to it. You know.

00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:22.712
So after I got used to like the texture, I think it's just the texture.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.120
Then I loved it. I realized it actually tastes so good. It's magical.

00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:32.193
The first time I had it, I was like 10 years old. And I almost threw up, sorry.

00:01:34.953 --> 00:01:37.160
But it's dry.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.152
