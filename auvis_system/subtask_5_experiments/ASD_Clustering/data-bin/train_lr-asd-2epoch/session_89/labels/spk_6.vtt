00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.950
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. The E. The E.

00:00:38.645 --> 00:00:40.197
So, there's no fourth?

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:45.972
Ohhh...

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.414
The G A F to the O.

00:01:01.106 --> 00:01:02.174
It's like a...

00:01:03.822 --> 00:01:06.100
B 7 @ 6

00:01:16.417 --> 00:01:18.287
With the E on the bottom. Bottom.

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:24.343
E major is a nice like key also. 

00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:28.005
Yeah, E major is pretty like, pretty like

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:31.464
It's like a different type of like bliss. It's just kind of like...

00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:47.378
I actually think it's... that burn.

00:01:48.287 --> 00:01:49.575
I think I have.

00:01:49.694 --> 00:01:54.194
My friend had a copy of it. It was like like a PDF of it.

00:01:54.194 --> 00:01:58.481
It's like back then they would like assign emotions to keys.

00:01:58.481 --> 00:02:01.619
And so they would choose keys for pieces.

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.885
I don't know. I'd have to see the... Yeah.

00:02:05.518 --> 00:02:10.512
But like the famous ones like C minor is like tragic and like...

00:02:11.462 --> 00:02:12.758
Or no heroic.

00:02:14.462 --> 00:02:16.487
No, E flat major is heroic.

00:02:17.753 --> 00:02:20.182
anyways let's... yeah.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.393
Yeah, basically. It was very systematic back then.

00:02:35.627 --> 00:02:36.450
Yeah.

00:02:39.945 --> 00:02:41.013
Oh...

00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:45.986
Yeah.

00:02:47.924 --> 00:02:51.654
Yeah, you can always explain scales and keys in different 

00:02:51.654 --> 00:02:52.380
ways, so...

00:02:54.101 --> 00:02:57.121
Oh, me too, don't worry. I forgot it.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.420
I mean in simple terms it would be like, if there was a

00:03:02.302 --> 00:03:04.900
C Major Chord we all know like just white keys.

00:03:05.508 --> 00:03:08.950
A certain melody.

00:03:09.592 --> 00:03:12.848
The main note would be the D.

00:03:12.848 --> 00:03:17.507
And that would be the mode is on like, the second mode like it.

00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:21.591
Did you change the note?

00:03:21.978 --> 00:03:25.324
I don't know. I'm not at that. I haven't learned that at school yet.

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:27.733
Yeah.

00:03:41.427 --> 00:03:43.514
So, Yeah, so D. 

00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:45.632
Yeah. 

00:03:48.472 --> 00:03:51.696
It's kind of like a vague thing, but

00:03:51.696 --> 00:03:56.691
Once you like base that into like your harmonies, that becomes like real like music theory.

00:03:56.691 --> 00:03:59.762
But the concept itself is a little weird cuz like

00:03:59.722 --> 00:04:02.728
Just use choose a note and you start from the note.

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:05.949
Yeah. 

00:04:09.188 --> 00:04:11.500
So, like D. D.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.716
Dory la la la la la

00:04:16.692 --> 00:04:17.840
Dorian is 2.

00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:25.530
No, but but I thought Dorian would make...

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.787
Since D is the second in, in C major.

00:04:30.424 --> 00:04:33.833
Whatever! No, we're just going crazy. We're just going crazy.

00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:36.548
No nos, no nos, no nos.

00:04:43.982 --> 00:04:45.649
The names are so...

00:04:45.966 --> 00:04:50.471
The names are so random too. I just, there's no way of remembering them.

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:51.967
It's true.

00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:56.495
Exactly. It's just too much.

00:04:59.483 --> 00:05:04.187
yeah and it's also like like branch off from that it's just too much.

00:05:24.137 --> 00:05:25.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:28.497
It's so instinctual.

00:05:48.997 --> 00:05:49.670
New.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.991
New.
