00:00:29.086 --> 00:00:30.346
Favorite Chords.

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.481
E is my favorite.

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:22.502
I like E major 7. I think that's my favorite chord.

00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:26.839
It sounds heavenly. Yeah.

00:01:58.378 --> 00:01:59.092
mmh

00:02:00.035 --> 00:02:01.204
What about the E?

00:02:03.238 --> 00:02:06.426
I have to go check it out.

00:02:07.904 --> 00:02:08.697
Oh.

00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:10.779
mmh

00:03:04.215 --> 00:03:05.087
mmh

00:03:15.951 --> 00:03:16.943
So, like...

00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:18.480
mmh

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:47.677
You have to stay within that key. You can start anywhere, but you have to stay within there.

00:03:47.677 --> 00:03:48.368
Okay.

00:03:55.756 --> 00:03:56.391
mmh

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:09.555
mmh

00:04:43.787 --> 00:04:46.081
You tell me straight.

00:05:03.718 --> 00:05:04.591
mmh

00:05:34.732 --> 00:05:35.729
Who's that?

00:05:49.971 --> 00:05:50.685
mmh

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:10.163
Using his theory.

00:06:19.163 --> 00:06:23.788
Okay. I love, like, in Mariachi.

00:06:23.788 --> 00:06:26.622
There's always like the first voice.
