WEBVTT

00:00:09.356 --> 00:00:10.621
It's rolling.

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:20.696
Samoan?

00:00:20.696 --> 00:00:24.644
It's like it's a collection of his story

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:25.792
Yeah.

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:30.888
yeah It's just the story of love.

00:00:30.888 --> 00:00:35.798
So it's like, it starts thousands of years ago.

00:00:35.798 --> 00:00:39.409
Well, like their history. Like their ancestors?

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:44.403
Though some of them, they're immortal, so some of them were already existent back then too.

00:00:44.403 --> 00:00:49.382
But it's just like how the elves in the Lord of the Rings are the elves.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.897
yeah They are in the book. yeah

00:00:51.897 --> 00:00:55.626
It's like all the  (***)

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:59.591
Unless they're killed.

00:01:04.588 --> 00:01:06.847
Yeah, the book is written by Tolkien.

00:01:07.403 --> 00:01:08.843
yeah

00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:11.522
yeah yeah

00:01:13.903 --> 00:01:16.451
yeah (***)

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:19.184
Yeah, a lot of the stories are really sad

00:01:19.184 --> 00:01:24.112
so I skipped over a lot of them. I just read the most famous ones.

00:01:24.112 --> 00:01:26.136
Yeah

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.379
mm

00:01:29.377 --> 00:01:34.338
I think the beginning of the book is really hard to read.

00:01:34.338 --> 00:01:38.877
(***) Meridian? Yeah, the beginning is still Meridian.

00:01:38.877 --> 00:01:43.282
yeah i just go to the ones where i know the characters are connected to the lord of the

00:01:43.282 --> 00:01:48.041
(***) oh 

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:50.775
haahaa

00:01:56.966 --> 00:02:01.454
Chronicles of Narnia. haahaa

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:03.734
haahaa

00:02:08.788 --> 00:02:12.745
haahaa

00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:15.444
haahaa

00:02:15.444 --> 00:02:20.441
haahaa (***) yeah

00:02:20.441 --> 00:02:24.894
Oh, really? Flipper.

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:26.870
finally ohh

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.536
Is it Disney? I guess the first two were Disney.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.554
Yeah, and then that third door (***)

00:02:45.905 --> 00:02:50.899
Don Trenner. But I don't think that one was Disney. They use the same actors?

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:54.358
but it wasn't Disney anymore.

00:02:54.358 --> 00:02:57.683
I think the overall movie quality, personally, was a little lower.

00:02:57.683 --> 00:03:01.058
Like a mouse, too. (***)

00:03:03.302 --> 00:03:07.724
You can't use the same actors yeah

00:03:07.724 --> 00:03:12.719
yeah so fourth book they only need one yeah of the same character

00:03:16.953 --> 00:03:21.426
i think no  (***)

00:03:21.426 --> 00:03:25.578

00:03:25.578 --> 00:03:28.548
(***) its really like 

00:03:28.548 --> 00:03:33.459
It's just a very disagreeable cousin of the original four

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.524
But then he changes because of his trip to Borneo.

00:03:37.524 --> 00:03:40.832
And then he comes out in the fourth one.

00:03:40.832 --> 00:03:44.477
