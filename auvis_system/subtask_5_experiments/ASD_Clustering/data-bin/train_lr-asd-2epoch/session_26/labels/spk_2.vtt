00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:12.393
Ha..ha..ha...ha

00:00:12.393 --> 00:00:15.212
I thought (***) yes

00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:18.249
 I do, um...

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:20.763
You know, it's funny because I.

00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:24.679
I've been thinking about what hobbies I should develop because...

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.289
I feel like I haven't been really actively

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.804
Passionately involved in a movie lately.

00:00:30.804 --> 00:00:33.319
I've been, you know, I could say yes.

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:38.177
So i like to read, which I do, when the pandemic hit.

00:00:38.177 --> 00:00:42.463
I was reading a lot and I loved it because all of a sudden we had all this quiet.

00:00:42.463 --> 00:00:44.978
Time and I finally....

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:49.957
got into ebooks which I never did before. I used to go to the library

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.844
or, you know, or read, you know, like,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.564
print and I picked up ebooks and I loved it.

00:00:58.564 --> 00:01:02.918
because I just felt it was so easy to...

00:01:02.918 --> 00:01:07.288
pick up only because most books I never read twice.

00:01:07.288 --> 00:01:09.803
I never go back to it. so umm...

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:14.713
I just kind of like to gloss around and if I don't like it I can always pick up

00:01:14.713 --> 00:01:19.707
Like i think so that was fun for a while umm

00:01:21.817 --> 00:01:26.811
Not as a child. My sister was actually the avid reader when I was a kid.

00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:31.285
And I would always want to play with dolls or something.

00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:35.317
Became mad at her because I wanted to.

00:01:35.317 --> 00:01:39.957
where she would like to read, but I did major in literature in college.

00:01:39.957 --> 00:01:44.716
So I finally got into reading later, I felt like, in life.

00:01:44.716 --> 00:01:50.192
and I really enjoyed it. and yeah...yes

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:58.285
I was not

00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:03.279
Um, I was debating on what to major in and I felt English

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:05.794
was a very practical major.

00:02:05.794 --> 00:02:10.180
I know lots of people are going into business or sciences and another (***)

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.143
In terms of just being able to kind of get a wide

00:02:15.143 --> 00:02:19.275
I think I want a wide range of exposure to different things.

00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:23.191
I felt like I could study philosophy and religion.

00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:25.959
And there no sciences but..

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.064
saying it's literature, it's reading.

00:02:29.064 --> 00:02:34.060
because you do get exposed to a wide variety of topics and things.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.856
That's kind of what I ended up gravitating toward.

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:40.792
Yes, it's developed into a...

00:02:40.792 --> 00:02:45.769
lifelong, I guess, love or, you know, just learning in general.

00:02:48.673 --> 00:02:53.078
Right now, I have been umm

00:02:53.078 --> 00:02:57.685
What did I read last? I remember I read Jimmy Carter's

00:02:57.685 --> 00:03:00.197
No more? Uh-huh.

00:03:00.197 --> 00:03:05.192
Before and i was just fascinated by his life.

00:03:05.193 --> 00:03:07.709
humble conditions.

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.504
and went on to just do extraordinary things.

00:03:11.504 --> 00:03:14.947
And so I do like biographies, if I could get ahead.

00:03:14.947 --> 00:03:19.131
Henry Michaels (***) I do like

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:22.676
I try to expand sometimes. I tend to...

00:03:22.676 --> 00:03:25.543
I think as I'm older and my...

00:03:25.543 --> 00:03:29.611
My grand teachers were more non-fiction.

00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:33.441
works versus before I used to.

00:03:33.441 --> 00:03:36.411
you know, want to pick up a fiction, a novel or two.

00:03:36.411 --> 00:03:41.390
But I still like and enjoy the occasional musical. right

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:53.709
You know when the pandemic hit..

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.375
I think I was going for a....

00:03:56.375 --> 00:04:01.369
I mean, I don't read that quickly, so I think I went through a good...

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:04.423
15, 20 titles.

00:04:04.423 --> 00:04:09.418
that first year within that year of the first month of the  pandemic.

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:16.119
but I usually don't read that much. I might go through a book.

00:04:16.119 --> 00:04:18.938
I might get into feces.

00:04:18.938 --> 00:04:23.915
read for a while and the like put it down and do something else.

00:04:32.268 --> 00:04:35.492
Yes, yes. I do most of my reading at night.

00:04:35.492 --> 00:04:40.064
I'll turn into bed early and just..

00:04:40.088 --> 00:04:44.628
lie on the bed that's where the inputs are great, because I don't...

00:04:44.604 --> 00:04:47.575
You have to put on a night light or you'll remember to turn it off.

00:04:47.575 --> 00:04:52.569
I just read them in the dark on my phone.

00:04:54.662 --> 00:04:58.593
I have on occasion been very, you know...

00:04:58.593 --> 00:05:02.795
I usually catch myself though and...

00:05:02.795 --> 00:05:07.403
head down and then I'm done. Yes, it helps me fall asleep.

00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:11.249
(***) then when i am waiting

00:05:25.256 --> 00:05:29.948
ohhhh

00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:36.090
okay

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.472
yeah i know

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:02.112
That was good. Yes, that's a good read.

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:06.819
I guess it depends what you like to read. I read...

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:10.566
You know when the pandemic hit, I remember...
