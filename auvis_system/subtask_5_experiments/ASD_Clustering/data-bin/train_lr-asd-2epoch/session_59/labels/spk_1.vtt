Oh...

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:33.845
Avocado.

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:35.705
Um. My favorite?

00:00:35.705 --> 00:00:39.114
a outside of... um. I was gonna

00:00:39.114 --> 00:00:41.628
I was gonna say. I was gonna say

00:00:41.628 --> 00:00:45.881
Hamburger, but I was going to say like American...

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:51.799
hamburgers and a barbeque but then after hamburgers and a barbeque

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.786
but Yeah, but I think after...

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.698
Like thinking about it, probably Mexican might be one of my favorites so...

00:01:00.698 --> 00:01:04.889

Aaah. But I heard a friend um, she had it at the tree.

00:01:23.154 --> 00:01:26.550
set and then she went back to New York and she couldn't find it.

00:01:27.184 --> 00:01:29.496
So I think it might be really old.

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.503
