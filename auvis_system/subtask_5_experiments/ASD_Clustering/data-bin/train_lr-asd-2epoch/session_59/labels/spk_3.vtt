Godzilla, Godzilla is the greatest.

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.578

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:07.193 --> 00:05:11.530
Yeah, yeah. You know what because the Godzilla doesn't have a target.

00:05:11.491 --> 00:05:15.963
when there's no other monsters to fight with, so they only take on the people.

00:05:16.003 --> 00:05:21.473
Right? And destroying properties. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's how things happen.

00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:23.796
Yeah.

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:24.463
Yeah. 

00:05:24.886 --> 00:05:28.371
Yeah, but why is it why is it Shin Godzilla like this?

00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:32.945
Why made, why made Shin Godzilla spit the fire like that he did?

00:05:34.015 --> 00:05:36.573
Start destroying things for no reason.

00:05:36.573 --> 00:05:41.143
Because he has no other monster to attack. Well, that's what he does.

00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:48.116
yeah yeah yeah so that was pretty cool but

00:05:48.036 --> 00:05:51.124
Yeah, so that was something that no one thought about.

00:05:51.203 --> 00:05:56.278
and then especially like the little laser thing come up on the back that was good

00:05:57.055 --> 00:05:59.588
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:01.176 --> 00:06:03.809
Yeah from the back, basically.

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:06.662
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

00:06:06.662 --> 00:06:11.268
that was something that was no one really thought about this. Yeah...

00:06:13.336 --> 00:06:14.129
