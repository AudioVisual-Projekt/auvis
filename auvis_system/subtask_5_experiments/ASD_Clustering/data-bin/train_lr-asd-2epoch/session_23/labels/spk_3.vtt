WEBVTT

00:00:40.783 --> 00:00:44.140
Okay, Yeah.

00:00:59.043 --> 00:01:04.317
I think my mom was more afraid because at that time I didn't

00:01:04.277 --> 00:01:08.476
I didn't know the fear of cancer. I was so far removed.

00:01:08.746 --> 00:01:11.344
Age wise, because I was only 17.

00:01:11.344 --> 00:01:14.011
So I didn't quite understand, so.

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:17.673
It was my mom doing yeah more. So I think.

00:01:17.673 --> 00:01:20.355
That's it like where I felt like okay

00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:25.215
It will make my mom happy if I go to church. It was for my mom.

00:01:25.638 --> 00:01:29.999
Yeah, when I went back to church. Yeah, and then...

00:01:31.152 --> 00:01:33.956
So even like getting baptized, like, oh.

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:38.362
I was gonna go to new jersey you know for so it would make my

00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:41.489
Dad and mom feel comfort

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:44.065
if I accept Christ, so

00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:49.060
It was more like I was doing it to please my parents, you know, yeah.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.709
Um And I did grow up.

00:01:52.215 --> 00:01:56.384
meanwhile Christo and I knew all the stories and I

00:01:56.384 --> 00:01:59.877
By that time I was like not fighting it anymore.

00:02:00.356 --> 00:02:02.325
Yeah, and then

00:02:02.645 --> 00:02:07.200
Of course I went to college. In the first year I'd fall away.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.605
***Oh, you know it's too far and then

00:02:12.836 --> 00:02:17.562
After that like, my mom was like, no, you need to go to church.

00:02:17.562 --> 00:02:22.556
And so um she hooked me up with like a local church.

00:02:22.556 --> 00:02:27.551
in New Jersey like she found someone and then they came and picked me up and I started

00:02:27.551 --> 00:02:32.547
Like, okay, mom's doing all this. But I I made good friends there, so

00:02:32.826 --> 00:02:34.582
Sunday I was like going

00:02:35.062 --> 00:02:38.726
to church to hang out with my friends more than.

00:02:39.884 --> 00:02:42.655
Hearing the words, it was like, yeah, I get to see my friends.

00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:47.651
But I think that was God's way, like, oh like, okay

00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:50.300
ch I Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.254
At that time, he was like, okay, the baby steps.

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:56.088
huh, And then...um

00:02:56.247 --> 00:02:59.277
So I, I you know, went to church.

00:02:59.277 --> 00:03:03.208
continue going to church. I graduated from college.

00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:06.901
And then, um after graduating, I started

00:03:06.861 --> 00:03:09.266
working but I worked in um

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:13.580
Silicon Valley. I was in an electronics like

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.096
trading firm, a Japanese trading firm and

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:20.253
haa, That's where I found depression.

00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:22.834
Major depression because...

00:03:22.834 --> 00:03:27.526
I felt so inadequate, like I was fresh out of college.

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:31.509
and then thrown into the business world.

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:35.289
i was like what am i supposed to do like i felt like

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:37.802
So, I felt like a baby.

00:03:37.802 --> 00:03:41.330
I knew I was getting a nice salary, but I knew I was not.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.789
competent, I didn't deserve like

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:48.367
I didn't deserve to be there and so I think I

00:03:48.367 --> 00:03:51.268
fell into major depression

00:03:51.268 --> 00:03:53.867
He remember, and

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:57.445
Still, I didn't really ask the Lord to help me.

00:03:57.765 --> 00:04:02.800
like and so I I really fell into severe depression.

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:04.949
where I was suicidal.

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:15.433
um I would dry cold because I hate it so cold.

00:04:15.314 --> 00:04:18.438
Thatway So on Friday night after work.

00:04:18.438 --> 00:04:21.441
I would get out of my car and drive home to LA.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.117
And then Sunday I'll go to service.

00:04:25.716 --> 00:04:27.939
And then drive back home but

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:32.528
I'm I'm dreading the drive home to San Francisco.

00:04:32.528 --> 00:04:35.313
Silicon Valley and so you know 

00:04:35.313 --> 00:04:39.076
That continued um for a while and then I...

00:04:39.315 --> 00:04:43.058
remember one day I was just...drive like

00:04:43.498 --> 00:04:46.821
trying to drive on to oncoming traffic

00:04:46.821 --> 00:04:49.336
Like I just found myself in it, heyy..

00:04:50.094 --> 00:04:53.082
But I think really like looking back,

00:04:53.082 --> 00:04:56.508
God was like calling out to me like

00:04:56.508 --> 00:05:01.013
Okay and then the car next to me started like...

00:05:01.013 --> 00:05:04.507
You could tell they were going crazy because their car ***

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:10.092
And that kind of made me snap out, and I'm like, what the heck am I doing?

00:05:10.092 --> 00:05:14.513
Like, what is going on? and then I, like

00:05:14.873 --> 00:05:17.736
At that point, I realize, okay, no, it's not normal.

00:05:17.736 --> 00:05:22.005
I'm not normal and  It was a wake-up call.

00:05:22.005 --> 00:05:25.837
And I finally went to my dad and I really, really.

00:05:25.837 --> 00:05:30.005
I can't do this. I hate everything about it.

00:05:30.005 --> 00:05:33.092
And that's when my dad like said, you know what?

00:05:33.651 --> 00:05:38.036
It's okay to quit. If you don't like it, just quit.

00:05:38.995 --> 00:05:40.660
And I felt...

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.972
like A huge relief.

00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:48.345
When my dad told me I can quit.

00:05:48.226 --> 00:05:52.702
But he said, but there's one condition. He goes, I will take you back.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.875
You can come back home, but there's...

00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:58.438
It's on one condition is um

00:05:59.037 --> 00:06:01.948
You can't come back until you find your next dream.

00:06:02.468 --> 00:06:05.167
And you can't quit until you find 

00:06:05.087 --> 00:06:09.491
your next goal and path for your life.

00:06:09.491 --> 00:06:13.897
You're not going to just quit and come back and sit around doing nothing.

00:06:13.897 --> 00:06:16.883
So until you find something.

00:06:17.882 --> 00:06:19.397
You need to make a living uhh

00:06:20.196 --> 00:06:23.853
heyy And so I'm like, huhuh

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.775
hey It was the it was one of the best things.

00:06:29.775 --> 00:06:34.046
ch um and then that's where I seriously started thinking.

00:06:34.325 --> 00:06:37.133
And I think in a sense, I didn't...

00:06:37.133 --> 00:06:42.128
understand what it was to pray pray about it, but I think...
