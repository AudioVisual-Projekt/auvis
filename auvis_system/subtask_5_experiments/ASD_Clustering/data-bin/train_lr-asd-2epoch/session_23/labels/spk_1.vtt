00:01:49.182 --> 00:01:52.102

Okay, because if you do end up going to school then, right? My god.

00:03:09.864 --> 00:03:12.731
I want you to really get to know that area.

00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:16.831
So when I go there to visit you, you're just showing all the good places.

00:03:18.755 --> 00:03:22.535
Like when I go to visit you there, you just show me all the good places.

00:03:31.647 --> 00:03:34.137
So have you looked at stuff?

00:03:34.617 --> 00:03:37.807

Like maybe like any cultural things you want to do?

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.759
no

00:04:05.701 --> 00:04:09.093
I don't know. Well, the only thing I know is they're like...

00:04:09.572 --> 00:04:13.969
The capital role in the producing like, you know, computer chips.

00:04:15.033 --> 00:04:15.725
Yeah.

00:04:20.618 --> 00:04:25.040

Oh you go to check that place out.

00:04:36.182 --> 00:04:37.814
 probably changed a lot.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.556
So your grandma and your mom's side lived there?

00:04:48.715 --> 00:04:50.672
Oh, that's right.

00:04:53.187 --> 00:04:54.301
Oh, after the war?

00:04:57.135 --> 00:05:01.211
Yeah, yeah it's time to

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.623
That's why we're everybody's favorite neighbor.

00:05:08.931 --> 00:05:10.907
Phone keeps sliding down.

00:05:17.335 --> 00:05:20.787
yeah, made this to wake

00:05:22.027 --> 00:05:22.988
Nice.

00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:32.051
but then if we go together and then you end up just like jamming up like every day

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.139
I think that would kind of eat at me.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.508
I don't know because your parents are there too.

00:05:49.976 --> 00:05:51.810
Yeah, yeah. yeah

00:05:52.692 --> 00:05:53.811

00:05:55.642 --> 00:05:57.919
How how long were you alone with her for?

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:02.745
Oh yeah it was! oh

00:06:04.237 --> 00:06:05.117

00:06:06.221 --> 00:06:07.774
No, it was only a few days.

00:06:09.563 --> 00:06:13.123
Because remember, as soon as we have time, I'm going to go visit my mom.

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:15.469
And that's when it started.

00:06:16.904 --> 00:06:21.866
yeah, yeah, I felt bad for you because you kind of like just

00:06:21.866 --> 00:06:26.017
I've heard around Oklahoma all the time to get me food.

00:06:26.017 --> 00:06:27.974
Yeah. Sorry, honey.

00:06:38.707 --> 00:06:41.498
