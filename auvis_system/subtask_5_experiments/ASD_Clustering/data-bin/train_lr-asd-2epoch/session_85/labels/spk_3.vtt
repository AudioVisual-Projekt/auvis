00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:18.475
Okay.

00:00:25.703 --> 00:00:28.564
I don't know, maybe it's the difference between talk on ghost.

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:32.267
So I usually may have cart board, cardboard.

00:00:32.267 --> 00:00:36.318
When I was a kid, I hated beets. I was naughty and I

00:00:36.318 --> 00:00:39.557
usually a lot of kids in our family. I would um

00:00:39.557 --> 00:00:45.004
And my parents couldn't notice everything. I would take a tiny bit of a beet and I'd smear it around on my plate.

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.066
So, it looked like I ate a lot.

00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:51.269
But then one time we were at someone's house after I was an adult and they served 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.264
Borscht. I'm thinking oh no, now I have to eat these. But actually, it wasn't that bad.

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:59.267
But then after we went to Ukraine and we had Borscht,

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:02.203
I really started to like beets and now I love it. I like I drink beets

00:01:02.203 --> 00:01:04.361
juice. I know. Yeah.

00:01:09.764 --> 00:01:10.726
No.

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:18.572
No. You can learn to like anything. When I went to Japan...

00:01:18.572 --> 00:01:21.289
the first time and I was staying at a homestay with a family.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.268
And um they said, oh, do you like green tea? I said, oh, I love green tea, because I was thinking the kind that we have.

00:01:26.268 --> 00:01:31.017
Like honey Oh, we have it at every meal so they gave me some when I drank

00:01:31.052 --> 00:01:34.857
it was a really really bitter it was really bitter kind of green tea.

00:01:34.857 --> 00:01:39.092
Really bitter. The Japanese one, just the regular...

00:01:39.092 --> 00:01:42.023
Very bitter one and I thought oh

00:01:41.815 --> 00:01:46.045
no, because now they think I like it and they thought I liked it so I was going to get it at every meal.

00:01:46.045 --> 00:01:50.854
I ate with my whole family. But I didn't want to say, oh, this isn't the kind they like.

00:01:50.854 --> 00:01:54.770
But literally by about a week, I started to really like it.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.283
and I just really got to love that tea.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:02:01.974
But the first time, I tried. Second time, I thought it was terrible.

00:02:01.974 --> 00:02:04.928
But I thought, well, OK, I'm just going to put up with it.

00:02:04.928 --> 00:02:07.661
It turned out that I liked it, and it's very healthy.

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:14.480
Yeah. Now how did you end up with a name like Larissa? because my, my um

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.766
Ukrainian girls, that was, that was a popular Russian name actually.

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:44.332
Of course they spell it in Cyrillic, right? but...

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:47.628
Very cool.

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:10.981
Oh, I like this one

00:03:14.183 --> 00:03:15.195
Right.

00:03:18.605 --> 00:03:21.810
Coz she had a feeling it was a boy when she was wrong uh...

00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:41.609
Spouse.

00:03:45.457 --> 00:03:46.915
That's your guess.

00:03:48.483 --> 00:03:50.205
I've actually done half of it.

00:03:53.822 --> 00:03:55.067
That's cool.

00:03:57.757 --> 00:03:58.451
Okay.

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:26.054
Well, If you're in Tucson yourself and you take that south route, you end up in San Diego.

00:04:26.054 --> 00:04:27.252
You come out, right?

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:38.939
Oh. That's the way we usually go. But then, Oh. Oh.

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:11.261
You could do what? Oh, okay.

00:05:39.831 --> 00:05:44.826
So, so you came in 2013 and then you had to go back for how long?

00:05:48.033 --> 00:05:50.400
And how long did you have this thing going on?

00:05:50.886 --> 00:05:54.152
Oh, you look like three years you were looking for a way to come back.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.757
So, how did you get back?
