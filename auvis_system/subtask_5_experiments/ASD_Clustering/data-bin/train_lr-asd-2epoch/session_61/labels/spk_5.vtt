00:02:31.724 --> 00:02:33.833
Godzilla turns into pink.

00:02:37.287 --> 00:02:40.408
What's the title of the movie? Orga Godzilla?

00:02:44.696 --> 00:02:48.020
That's the.. the latest movie? Oh, oh. Okay, okay.

00:02:50.264 --> 00:02:53.616
Yeah, They're constantly making the new ones.

00:02:54.198 --> 00:02:56.527
Yeah, everybody loves Godzilla.

00:02:57.643 --> 00:02:58.458
Yeah. 

00:02:58.808 --> 00:02:59.779
So...

00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:02.440
But there's always...

00:03:05.655 --> 00:03:10.650
But the Gamera is such a minor character compared to Godzilla, so I don't know.

00:03:11.426 --> 00:03:12.485
But...

00:03:13.255 --> 00:03:14.031
Yeah. 

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:18.953
So Gamera always have a the boy boy a the friend who's a boy.

00:03:18.953 --> 00:03:22.394
Yeah, always a little little kid with...yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:22.865 --> 00:03:23.835
So...

00:03:26.137 --> 00:03:30.072
Yeah, yeah in Gamera? So maybe that would be the theme of like a

00:03:30.072 --> 00:03:33.835
when Godzilla and Gamera come out and then the Gamera is trying to

00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:38.122
Protect people, but the Godzilla but Godzilla doesn't eat people.

00:03:38.122 --> 00:03:41.227
So I don't know how that's going to work.

00:03:45.277 --> 00:03:50.086
Oh, yeah. So it's gonna be not gonna be Nassau, Shingojira anymore

00:03:50.086 --> 00:03:54.475
that's the title it's like not not so not so single yet.

00:03:56.078 --> 00:04:00.263
Shin-Shin. Shi-Shin Godzilla.

00:04:00.263 --> 00:04:02.776
Yeah, yeah. Shingola.

00:04:03.553 --> 00:04:05.802
It's a very... it's a silent movie.

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:16.703
Yeah. 

00:04:18.876 --> 00:04:22.369
For three days? What for the Shin Godzilla?

00:04:24.545 --> 00:04:27.490
Isn't that how the movie ends at the end?

00:04:28.432 --> 00:04:29.403
Yeah. 

00:04:31.295 --> 00:04:33.625
In the beginning in the beginning

00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:37.658
Oh, in Shin Godzilla? Would he?

00:04:40.358 --> 00:04:43.750
Oh, he's become not moving.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.276
He was almost like getting his energy back.

00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:48.578
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:48.967 --> 00:04:53.250
But he wasn't frozen or anything. He was, he stopped moving.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.894
Yeah, for for I don't know how many how how long how long was he stopped moving like that?

00:04:58.632 --> 00:04:59.881
Three days?

00:04:59.976 --> 00:05:01.063
Oh.

00:05:02.872 --> 00:05:03.765
Yeah. 

00:05:04.084 --> 00:05:07.332
Because they don't wanna wake him up, I think, no?

00:05:11.474 --> 00:05:12.677
Yeah. 

00:05:13.281 --> 00:05:17.230
But in Shin Godzilla that time it wasn't a defeat actually that's when the

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.690
the spit fire starts to do like the whole fire thing smoke and the fire and the beam.

00:05:23.428 --> 00:05:24.851
That was before?

00:05:24.805 --> 00:05:25.854

00:05:30.694 --> 00:05:31.937
Yeah. 

00:05:34.897 --> 00:05:36.939
Yeah. Stop...

00:05:42.255 --> 00:05:43.656

00:05:46.694 --> 00:05:48.014
Oh.

00:05:50.337 --> 00:05:54.995
So, so is there is there like a main person character in Shin Godzilla?
