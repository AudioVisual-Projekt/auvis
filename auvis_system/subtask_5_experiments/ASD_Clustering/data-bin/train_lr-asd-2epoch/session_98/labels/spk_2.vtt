WEBVTT

00:00:39.062 --> 00:00:43.734
So, so we have to talk about what is the ratings.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.198
Favorite character?

00:00:49.598 --> 00:00:50.420
mmh

00:00:52.404 --> 00:00:54.229
I can never choose. 

00:00:54.503 --> 00:00:59.258
oh wait well let's let's stay with both the 

00:01:01.317 --> 00:01:02.173
um...

00:01:05.092 --> 00:01:07.706
Yeah, for now.

00:01:09.247 --> 00:01:12.711
So, strictly, strictly Lothlorien not Hobbit.

00:01:17.603 --> 00:01:21.654
Gandalf? uh... I think, actually...

00:01:21.654 --> 00:01:25.620
Well, my family's asked me so many times about my favorite character.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.652
I've never like been able to decide, but right now I feel like...

00:01:29.652 --> 00:01:32.188
it actually might be Aragorn.

00:01:33.078 --> 00:01:37.905
I found out I have the same personality type as him. So I was like, oh.

00:01:37.905 --> 00:01:41.363
Okay, and I think he's become

00:01:41.363 --> 00:01:43.758
more of the favorite, since then.

00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:46.784
Yeah.

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.142
Aww, that's cute! It's...

00:01:52.518 --> 00:01:55.413
Yeah, he's so cute!

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.877
Yeah.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.378
He loves to begin...

00:02:04.506 --> 00:02:05.270
Yes.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.202
yeah 

00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:13.044
mmm-hmm

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.529
mmm-hmm

00:02:20.636 --> 00:02:21.424
mmm-hmm

00:02:24.413 --> 00:02:28.142
Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.579
mmm-hmm

00:02:35.584 --> 00:02:40.583
Yeah... yeah. The bittersweet ending.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.360
Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:51.293 --> 00:02:54.902
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah...

00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:56.869
After they come back?

00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:01.015
They sent them in to the shire. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:02.693 --> 00:03:05.582
Yeah. Yeahhh

00:03:07.452 --> 00:03:10.180
Yeah, yeah. It actually cut a lot of scene.

00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:13.822
I think they'll need a whole like one more movie to cover that though.

00:03:13.822 --> 00:03:18.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Where they come back.

00:03:20.803 --> 00:03:24.363
Yes, they could definitely do that.

00:03:25.048 --> 00:03:25.912
Yeah.

00:03:32.688 --> 00:03:36.485
Uh... Uh-huh... Oh really?

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:38.172
Uh-huh.

00:03:41.548 --> 00:03:45.192
To three movies! Yeah...

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:47.430
Yeah.

00:03:50.036 --> 00:03:54.544
Just for the, the, the ending part, yeah. I think...

00:04:02.085 --> 00:04:04.479
Really? I didn't know that.

00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:06.423
mmm-hmm

00:04:06.944 --> 00:04:10.894
Yeah, I like the movie better than the book, too, for The Hobbit.

00:04:11.578 --> 00:04:13.544
Yeah, because...

00:04:15.135 --> 00:04:15.923
Yeah.

00:04:15.804 --> 00:04:20.091
I think Tolkien wrote it really for like a children's audience.

00:04:20.056 --> 00:04:24.865
He actually didn't like the way he talked to the audience in The Hobbit.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.894
So I, I don't know, he might have liked the movie. That's what I think.

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:30.962
Yeah...

00:04:34.327 --> 00:04:38.946
Out of the three Lord of the Rings books, do you have a favorite Shawgo.

00:04:41.268 --> 00:04:43.254
Ohhh. Yeah.

00:04:43.294 --> 00:04:46.686
Yeah, I said the same thing last time.

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:51.782
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:53.587 --> 00:04:57.665
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And they have to cut it.

00:04:58.349 --> 00:04:59.299
Yeah.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.856
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was really long to publish in one volume.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.975
yeah 

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:12.092
Yeah, yeah. it's also the shortest.

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:19.487
mmm-hmm

00:05:23.182 --> 00:05:23.901
mmm-hmm

00:05:26.054 --> 00:05:29.717
Like, there's Sam! He's the same height as everybody else!

00:05:31.976 --> 00:05:33.044
I know!

00:05:34.037 --> 00:05:37.938
I think Woodlawn this one uh...

00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:41.348
I don't think so.

00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:45.662
Yeah.

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:52.212
Aww... I didn't know.

00:05:55.636 --> 00:05:58.285
Yeah. I think I have heard of that one.

00:05:58.285 --> 00:06:03.111
Is that a movie? I don't , I don't think we've seen it but that kind of movie.

00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:08.107
Uh-huh. uh uh uh Ohhh

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:10.313

Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:06:14.033 --> 00:06:16.474

Uh-huh.

00:06:27.905 --> 00:06:29.069
Ohhh...

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.013
Yeah. Oh, Really? Aww.
