Gandalf. Yeah.

00:01:21.377 --> 00:01:22.062

And he goes. And he goes, don't you let go. Oh my God.

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:03.912
Well, that's only in the movie, he never said that in the

00:02:03.912 --> 00:02:06.849
in the book. He never said that in the book.

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:09.886
Wait, have you read both the book and book, and watched the movie?

00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:28.388
Yeah.

00:02:40.917 --> 00:02:43.330
Yeah, I like those kind of endings too.

00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:48.158
Yeah.

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:55.483
Three? Which part?

00:02:57.963 --> 00:03:02.249
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember. I remember. But they didn't do that movie because they had to probably cut.

00:03:02.695 --> 00:03:03.533
But...

00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:05.655
Yeah.

00:03:05.641 --> 00:03:07.688
Because the rangers didn't leave. 

00:03:09.505 --> 00:03:10.865
Yeah, and the song.

00:03:16.965 --> 00:03:20.745
Maybe they should make like, make like a small like series.

00:03:25.398 --> 00:03:26.258
yo...

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:27.428

00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:29.721
yeah 

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:54.684
yeah 

00:03:56.807 --> 00:04:01.801
A movie of Hobbit? Oh yeah, I like that one. Actually, I might like that better than Lord of the Rings movie.

00:04:02.487 --> 00:04:06.796
Book, I like the... Book, I like Lord of the rings probably better, but...

00:04:29.977 --> 00:04:30.663
yeah 

00:04:33.017 --> 00:04:33.703
So...

00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:43.175
Oh, I like, I might think Return of the Kings. That's good.

00:04:45.132 --> 00:04:46.504
Uh. Uh.

00:04:56.175 --> 00:04:56.793

00:05:10.052 --> 00:05:10.772
yeah 

00:05:13.757 --> 00:05:16.254
But I guess, but you know.

00:05:16.254 --> 00:05:19.983
The actor who played Samwise in the movie

00:05:19.983 --> 00:05:25.071
like there's like some other movies where the same actor comes out so like i kind of like those movies only

00:05:24.831 --> 00:05:26.432
because that actor came out. 

00:05:30.203 --> 00:05:32.247
He's not a hobbit and he wears shoes.

00:05:37.196 --> 00:05:40.435
Yeah, I didn't leave. Hey, were you there when we watched it?

00:05:40.435 --> 00:05:44.674
Oh, okay. But yeah, I did like raptor movie because he came out.

00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:45.855
Yeah.

00:05:56.811 --> 00:05:58.408
Yeah. He's in that one?

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.104
Ahhhh

00:06:13.194 --> 00:06:13.983
yeah 

00:06:14.658 --> 00:06:17.156
I remember one time, like...

00:06:17.156 --> 00:06:21.172
Like only once as an actor who played Aragorn in the movie.

00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:25.661
Like I saw like, like a preview of the same actor in a different movie.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.325
like i think they're like western. 

00:06:36.616 --> 00:06:37.267
yeah
