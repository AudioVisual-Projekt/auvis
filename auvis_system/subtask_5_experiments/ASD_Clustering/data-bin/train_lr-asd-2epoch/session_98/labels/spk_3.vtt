WEBVTT

00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:40.698
Okay.

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:44.798
Lord of the Rings?

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.058
Oh my gosh, favorite character.

00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:54.384
wait...

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.930
Wait, as... are we staying in Lord of the Rings?

00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:09.719
Okay, for now. Favorite character from Lord of the Rings.

00:01:18.363 --> 00:01:19.158
Gandalf?

00:01:32.354 --> 00:01:33.610
Aragorn.

00:01:35.763 --> 00:01:37.100
Ohhh

00:01:45.678 --> 00:01:49.953
Aragorn. I would say I like Samwise Gamgee.

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:53.583
Yeah, I just think his loyalty, Mr.

00:01:53.583 --> 00:01:55.079
Frodo.

00:01:56.763 --> 00:01:57.483
And...

00:01:58.027 --> 00:01:59.391
Yeah... just...

00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:06.417
In the mo. Yeah.

00:02:06.863 --> 00:02:07.946
But...

00:02:09.968 --> 00:02:13.820
I watched the. Okay, I read the book, I only read it like...

00:02:14.575 --> 00:02:17.257
once all the way through.

00:02:17.943 --> 00:02:21.324
I... I read Hobbit twice.

00:02:21.358 --> 00:02:24.665
but I can't remember anything from Hobbit, honestly.

00:02:24.665 --> 00:02:27.942
That, It just didn't leave a lasting impression but

00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:31.181
Lord of the Rings, yeah... it's

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:33.088
Well, 

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:35.718
the ending was quite different.

00:02:36.382 --> 00:02:38.524
Yeah, I kind of like that.

00:02:40.308 --> 00:02:41.199
Yeah.

00:02:43.603 --> 00:02:46.756
Yeah, I.... but you know how in the book...

00:02:47.681 --> 00:02:51.699
um The hobbits all stand up and fight, right?

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.074
And I like that scene. And ohhh

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.537
they all come back.

00:03:01.318 --> 00:03:05.554
yeah they had cut that and I really like that part a lot.

00:03:07.507 --> 00:03:08.510
yeah

00:03:10.274 --> 00:03:11.119
Yeah.

00:03:12.557 --> 00:03:15.781
Just, yeah, right? Just a little final stand.

00:03:21.193 --> 00:03:23.373
I think they're not that win.

00:03:23.864 --> 00:03:28.604
Yeah... See, I feel like rather than

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:29.483
um

00:03:30.772 --> 00:03:34.984
Taking that hobbit, like I really did not like the hobbit movie.

00:03:35.223 --> 00:03:37.633
Coz um Well, it was okay.

00:03:37.633 --> 00:03:40.704
But I didn't really think they should 

00:03:40.704 --> 00:03:44.418
Stretched it out into three movies like they could have

00:03:44.418 --> 00:03:47.084
Maybe give it two of these

00:03:47.084 --> 00:03:52.044
But I would have liked to do that one movie just at the ending of The Hobbit.

00:03:52.044 --> 00:03:54.623
Yeah. Yeah.

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.053
Do you like the movie too?

00:03:57.881 --> 00:03:58.601
Yup.

00:04:01.698 --> 00:04:02.990
Oh really? 

00:04:05.994 --> 00:04:06.782
mmm-hmm

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:16.198
Oh, yeah. I... I mean, I don't remember the book too much.

00:04:19.775 --> 00:04:20.597
mmm-hmm

00:04:29.085 --> 00:04:29.753
Yeah.

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:32.159
yeah 

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:43.741
Return of the... Oh. Yeah.

00:04:45.783 --> 00:04:50.263
I would say Return of... Well, it's the climax of the whole.

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:55.258
Right, because originally that was just one book. Right? and then

00:04:56.115 --> 00:04:58.279
for marketing purposes

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:02.999
they split it into three I I don't know if it was marketing purpose or

00:05:05.164 --> 00:05:10.159
Yeah, so I would say it's the climax. It was the most exciting

00:05:10.741 --> 00:05:13.003
part. Yeah

00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:26.812
Yeah...

00:05:32.658 --> 00:05:34.531
Wait, which movie was this?

00:05:36.856 --> 00:05:37.878
Okay.

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:42.229
No.

00:05:46.356 --> 00:05:49.698
He was a heartthrob when he was young, like

00:05:49.698 --> 00:05:53.967
Yeah, he was in like... Oh he, he

00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:58.489
He was in Goonies. Yeah. When... Yeah.

00:05:58.489 --> 00:06:01.780
Have you seen Goonies? No.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.462
It's an old mov, adventure movie.

00:06:04.462 --> 00:06:07.304
And I liked him from then.

00:06:09.087 --> 00:06:11.885
And then he's done a lot of little quirky...

00:06:12.056 --> 00:06:14.385
Movies in between but

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.046
mmm-hmm

00:06:27.362 --> 00:06:32.256
uh Yeah, I have to say Aragorn was his best role.

00:06:32.256 --> 00:06:36.588
Yeah, he, once he played that, he couldn't play any other movies.

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:39.022
Although he is a good actor.
