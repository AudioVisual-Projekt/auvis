00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:27.677
No talking about food?

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.997
Okay. What's your favorite food?

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:52.375
Do you know how to make it? Do you make it at home?

00:00:55.295 --> 00:00:57.196
The roll thing or the...

00:01:01.237 --> 00:01:03.094
When you just throw fish in?

00:01:06.927 --> 00:01:08.039
nori and...

00:01:18.924 --> 00:01:22.060
Do you roll it for like a cone or do you actually? 

00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:23.260
or you could...

00:01:46.087 --> 00:01:47.548
What is that?

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.251
Oh, Donburi.

00:02:02.057 --> 00:02:06.713
It's actually mixed in with the rice. It's not like just a ball of white rice, everything's on top.

00:02:06.713 --> 00:02:11.355
Oh, it's on top? Oh, sort of like the bing bing, the Korean thing.

00:02:13.307 --> 00:02:14.259
Oh!

00:02:29.665 --> 00:02:30.380
mmh

00:02:42.134 --> 00:02:43.480
Oh. That's interesting.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.278
Well, Aomori is actually still on Honshu. It's on the top. It's not even Hokkaido.

00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:28.047
oh i didn't think oh it didn't seem that bad

00:03:28.523 --> 00:03:32.793
Well, I lived in Hokkaido for three years. In Asahikawa.

00:03:32.793 --> 00:03:35.307
Asahikawa. In the middle.

00:03:35.307 --> 00:03:39.932
And yeah, there was a lot of snow but it can sort of melt down you know yeah and then

00:03:39.932 --> 00:03:44.927
But there was snow so often that it always looked white and beautiful. The only time it was ugly and mushy,

00:03:44.927 --> 00:03:47.997
like one week around the end of April when everything melted.

00:03:47.997 --> 00:03:50.985
But they did a really good job keeping the roads clear.

00:03:50.985 --> 00:03:55.490
The other thing was that it warmed up quite a bit in the daytime, so it might be like 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.321
minus 20 or 25 at night, but you're, you're inside.

00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:03.151
And then when you wake up in the, in the morning, it's really not that cold.

00:04:03.151 --> 00:04:05.665
Yeah, I used to actually go out at night.

00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:10.642
and do the grocery shopping like at 10 at night after the kids went to bed my husband always

00:04:10.642 --> 00:04:13.293
I would take a sled and just walk to the store.

00:04:13.928 --> 00:04:17.731
Yeah. That was like 20 years before she was born, so...

00:04:18.786 --> 00:04:19.581
Yeah. 

00:04:28.177 --> 00:04:30.425
Well, it's right kind of in the middle of the island.

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.884
So...

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.727
I would go to Asahikawa. I love Asahikawa. It was beautiful.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.355
You know what. I'm, wasn't. We didn't really eat much seafood when we were there.

00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:54.739
Well, well sort of.... sort of like the diamond.

00:04:54.739 --> 00:04:59.734
Like, you know, there's a part down there that has Hakodate kind of in the southwest, but then you've got sort of the big diamond.

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:02.434
we were in the middle of the diamond. So we really, a

00:05:02.434 --> 00:05:05.521
like about as far away from the ocean as you could get.

00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:09.285
So we didn't see a lot of seafood but one time we did see

00:05:09.285 --> 00:05:12.323
One of my friends, I went in the grocery store with her and there was...

00:05:12.323 --> 00:05:16.052
Whale... and she's like, oh, Kujira!

00:05:16.052 --> 00:05:20.530
And so I went home and I told my husband, oh, it's so cool, I had Kujira in the store.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.353
Go back quick, buy it. This is probably the only chance we'll ever get to eat it.

00:05:25.032 --> 00:05:25.943
Whale!

00:05:27.006 --> 00:05:30.158
Whale. And it's like a beef. It's like beef.

00:05:30.794 --> 00:05:33.028
You just cook it in a little bit of olive oil.

00:05:33.028 --> 00:05:38.221
and salt. Yeah. They sell it like beef. It tasted a lot like beef honestly.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.939
It really, it was I was expecting it to be weird and it wasn't.

00:05:43.138 --> 00:05:44.012
but as...

00:05:51.648 --> 00:05:52.521
Well...

00:05:56.011 --> 00:05:59.437
But I bet you they did a better job, because like we didn't know if we were doing it right. So

00:05:59.437 --> 00:06:02.408
It was a little tough like it wasn't even when you cook

00:06:02.408 --> 00:06:05.107
steaks sometimes it's hard to get it, you know, just right.

00:06:05.107 --> 00:06:09.595
So, you know, it wasn't really that chewy, but there's probably like

00:06:09.595 --> 00:06:14.590
it's like a better way to do it but my friend just told me we'll just cook a little bit of olive oil

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.843
It was okay, but I bet you the restaurant had really nice food.

00:06:18.843 --> 00:06:21.054
seasoned and everything. Right?

00:06:25.078 --> 00:06:27.057
Oh. I don't, to me it tastes like beef.
