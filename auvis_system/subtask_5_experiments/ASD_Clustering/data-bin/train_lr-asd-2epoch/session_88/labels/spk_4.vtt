Okay.

00:00:21.017 --> 00:00:21.790
Yup.

00:00:24.923 --> 00:00:27.220
All right. So...

Long time ago, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. mmh.

00:01:10.326 --> 00:01:11.548

How about you? What do you listen to?

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.292
mmh

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:27.289
That's, I'd like to disagree.

Every week he'd come to me, he'd be like, Naoko, listen to this.

Oh. Okay. ay, okay okay... Okay.

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.248
Yeah. He went down a rabbit hole, like, during COVID.

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:00.158
That's what made him.

00:02:02.287 --> 00:02:02.980

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:05.367
Yeah. 

00:02:08.485 --> 00:02:09.692

Yeah. 

00:03:57.286 --> 00:03:59.316
It's stylistic.

00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:29.038
Or like being like a showman, or like

00:04:29.038 --> 00:04:32.734
being like a performer, you know?

00:04:35.907 --> 00:04:40.038

00:05:17.842 --> 00:05:22.837
like the boys behind me in my first theory class, that's what they were talking about.

00:05:22.716 --> 00:05:27.181
They got to know each other and they were like, hey what's your favorite chord? And I was like nerds.

00:05:28.484 --> 00:05:32.014
Yeah, with that diminished 7th, it's really quick. It's really great.

00:05:32.014 --> 00:05:33.442
I was like... fuck.

00:05:45.514 --> 00:05:47.125
Interesting.

00:05:51.202 --> 00:05:56.028
C major. That's probably your favorite. C major.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.932
Yeah...

00:06:00.072 --> 00:06:02.373

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:04.590
Do you have a favorite chord?

00:06:20.793 --> 00:06:21.719
