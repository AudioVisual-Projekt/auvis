00:00:13.017 --> 00:00:16.573
So... Here, I'll try and move my camera.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.085
Like this.... Okay. Okay.

00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:21.566
Alright, so we left off like

00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:25.041
and then the missionary thing and your...

00:00:25.278 --> 00:00:30.155
Your husband was here and you weren't here. I think my question I was going to ask you is like...

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:35.033
So, do you want the mission right here, or was it strictly you need to be here?

00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:36.989
mmm-hmm

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:51.064
Uh-huh.

00:00:56.768 --> 00:00:57.812
Ohoho. Wow

00:01:04.244 --> 00:01:07.061
Right. Oh, wow.

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:29.674
Right.

00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:40.669
Oh, Wow.

00:01:52.556 --> 00:01:53.472

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:01.424
Uh-huh.

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:11.520
Okay.

00:02:17.754 --> 00:02:19.451
You didn't get to talk to the Japanese.

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:25.240
Oh.

00:02:32.264 --> 00:02:32.898
Right.

00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:41.023
mmm-hmm

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:48.122
Oh.

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:55.927
Okay.

00:03:03.127 --> 00:03:04.107
Right.

00:03:17.717 --> 00:03:18.412
Wow.

00:03:25.398 --> 00:03:26.043
mmh

00:03:27.535 --> 00:03:28.214
Right.

00:03:44.995 --> 00:03:45.784
Wow.

00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:01.497
So, you. Is your daughter still there?

00:04:01.902 --> 00:04:06.017
Oh, okay. Oh, okay, okay. I didn't know.

00:04:07.607 --> 00:04:08.519
Oh my goodness.

00:04:17.664 --> 00:04:18.403
Okay.

00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:26.289
Wow.

00:04:27.046 --> 00:04:32.041
And do they speak? Do they speak Russian? They speak Russian?

00:04:41.132 --> 00:04:41.981
Oh.

00:04:44.057 --> 00:04:45.131
Okay.

00:04:56.442 --> 00:05:00.086
So it like all came back from the naturally? Okay, that's good.

00:05:04.915 --> 00:05:06.120
Restaurant?

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.935
It was funny, the other day. I had uh, I went to an Armenian restaurant.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.533
And she's like, this voice is 

00:05:14.533 --> 00:05:17.132
just like Russian voice. Oh, okay.

00:05:17.132 --> 00:05:21.212
And I had only had it, yeah, I had had it by, um...

00:05:22.333 --> 00:05:26.262
The person who taught my mom's husband was from the middle.

00:05:26.262 --> 00:05:29.906
And so I guess I don't know if it's that style, but...

00:05:29.906 --> 00:05:34.901
I was like, I never need a borsch. You could make it, hard. Well, that was always cold.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:38.563
Yes.

00:05:41.398 --> 00:05:42.179
Oh.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.414
Uh-huh.

00:06:01.784 --> 00:06:02.540
Right.
