WEBVTT

00:00:13.314 --> 00:00:15.964
Hi! Nice to meet you. Yeah.

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:19.152
I can barely hear you, but

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:22.986
It's okay. Yeah, where are we talking?

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.400
We were talking about North... North America City.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:32.294
And what?

00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:38.174
Oh, I, I gotta say, it's Mexico.

00:00:41.884 --> 00:00:44.871
Hmmm. Nope, it's a You Tube. Yeah.

00:00:48.363 --> 00:00:52.820
I gotta say, I love tacos. But other than that...

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.839
I'm not sure actually. Wait. Actually...

00:00:57.982 --> 00:01:01.883
What? Actually, I don't like... um

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.482
What's that place called? uh Washington DC. I hate it.

00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:11.786
It's too bustling.

00:01:12.122 --> 00:01:13.364
It's too bustling.

00:01:15.884 --> 00:01:18.637
You know. You know. It's, It's like

00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:21.792
It's like Tokyo or something. Bustling.

00:01:23.918 --> 00:01:26.437
Dirty. It's like Tokyo but dirtier.

00:01:28.676 --> 00:01:30.533
Yeah, it's just dirty.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:34.166
Full of germy grime.

00:01:35.174 --> 00:01:39.007
Germy grime. Oh, yeah. Germany. Germany is not.

00:01:40.687 --> 00:01:42.805
Bread in Germany is vintage.

00:01:47.828 --> 00:01:50.735
And cheese. Bread and cheese, we were talking about that too.

00:01:55.913 --> 00:01:57.898
I think Europe has the best bread.

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:03.954
Which place has the best bread?

00:02:05.937 --> 00:02:08.403
The best bread. Yeah.

00:02:09.814 --> 00:02:14.037
I mean, maybe it's different, maybe it's different for each country.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.762
Cause like, German can't have good sandwiches bread.

00:02:19.568 --> 00:02:20.436
And...

00:02:21.276 --> 00:02:23.994
And then France could have good baguette bread.

00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:27.742
And then Japan could have good milk bread with melon bread.

00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:31.164
And USA has uh... white bread.

00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:36.193
Like normal, I don't know, you're also a percentage. Processed, right?

00:02:40.682 --> 00:02:43.669
And they have tacos. They have corn tacos.

00:02:46.156 --> 00:02:47.147
Yup.

00:02:52.984 --> 00:02:55.499
Oh. Uh, What is it called?

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.337
Nan or something? No, no, no. What the... The stuff that they eat with hummus?

00:03:02.278 --> 00:03:04.275
Pita. Pita bread. Pita.

00:03:05.888 --> 00:03:09.203
Pita bread and hummus. Damn.

00:03:10.446 --> 00:03:11.297
Um...

00:03:12.204 --> 00:03:17.199
That is one of the best things to eat in the, in the Middle East. In the entire Middle East.

00:03:18.712 --> 00:03:21.034
Yes, that's a core memory of mine.

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:24.389
The random guy with the best bread I've ever had.

00:03:25.128 --> 00:03:28.253
Randomly. It was just random, and dad was like, let's eat this.

00:03:28.455 --> 00:03:32.471
on the street, but... And I thought it was sketchy but it was actually good.

00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:38.074
And just dipping the bread.

00:03:38.074 --> 00:03:42.530
in your hummus and then with the falafel too. It's phenomenal.

00:03:44.546 --> 00:03:45.448
I think.

00:03:45.448 --> 00:03:47.730
That was one of my core memories.

00:03:51.032 --> 00:03:52.709
Especially um...

00:03:54.694 --> 00:03:58.177
I know. Who's watching this video?

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:07.793
I have never been to Africa.

00:04:08.197 --> 00:04:10.697
So I wouldn't know. Oh!

00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:18.995
My favorite city is in Brazil.

00:04:19.298 --> 00:04:21.240
Because then in Brazil...

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.925
They have really good chocolate. You know they make really good chocolate in Brazil?

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:26.212
Like

00:04:26.437 --> 00:04:29.307
for example, one of my...

00:04:29.576 --> 00:04:31.957
Brazilian friends have made me uh

00:04:31.957 --> 00:04:36.514
like a little round chocolate with I don't know like little sprinkles on it.

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:40.107
But it was too expensive. It was like $3 for one or something.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.517
I didn't want to buy it. Wait, it was like,

00:04:44.088 --> 00:04:47.583
It was in Japan. Cause you know there's a lot of...

00:04:47.784 --> 00:04:51.631
Uh Brazilian people were in Japan. And

00:04:56.174 --> 00:04:56.913
Yeah.

00:04:58.196 --> 00:05:00.225
Yeah. Really? Can I go?

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:03.182
Wait. Where is it? Is it here? I know it.

00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:09.587
Wait, why don't you invite me? I wanna go. Yeah, I do. I love jazz.

00:05:10.701 --> 00:05:15.477
I love jazz and I love fusion. Mmmmm.

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:18.363
Okay. But, but then you'd go by yourself?

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:24.099
Oh, Which friend? Wait, that one guy you said is cool?

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:27.359
Yeah. You shouldn't mind me.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.715
I want to go because I love. I really appreciate good music. You know.

00:05:34.538 --> 00:05:38.054
I appreciate it. OK, wait, wait. What were you talking about?

00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:42.123
Places, right? Okay, what place has the best music genre? genres?

00:05:42.594 --> 00:05:44.723
Stop. What place?

00:05:46.336 --> 00:05:48.891
It is, it's talking about different places.

00:05:49.395 --> 00:05:54.390
And that counts. Yeah. And wait, yeah. And the best bread is like around there.

00:05:56.642 --> 00:05:58.272
I think. I think

00:05:58.507 --> 00:06:01.494
I don't know where it came from but like

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.630
the... Am I allowed to say the black people genre? That's the best.

00:06:06.773 --> 00:06:07.847
Like a gospel.

00:06:09.595 --> 00:06:13.009
That style? You know, Fujikaze uses that style.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:15.585
Okay.
