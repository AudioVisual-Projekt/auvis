00:00:32.763 --> 00:00:37.217
Hey Josh, how are you doing? Good.

00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:39.068
Well, today.

00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:43.268
I don't know. Talk about our family trip.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.998
Past and future. What was your favorite?

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.573
Okinawa, yeah, yeah. 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.926
Yeah, because we went there for, um,  maki's,

00:01:04.926 --> 00:01:10.671
No, not Maki's Fuki's wedding. So we decided to go to...

00:01:09.887 --> 00:01:12.402
Was that Okinawa first?

00:01:12.402 --> 00:01:16.722
You know, actually that was one of the most peaceful...

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:20.063
Calm family trips that we've ever taken I think

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:26.930
Don't you think it was calm? Like usually some chaos ensues.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.843
But that time, I'm uh can't go  being sick.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.188
It was rather... uhm.

00:01:34.188 --> 00:01:38.753
Calm, I think. Is it Okinawa?

00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:41.105
Cause there's like... I don't know.

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:46.000
But yeah, Okiniwa, where else?

00:01:47.063 --> 00:01:50.618
Yeah, like right, that San Francisco trip.

00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:54.944
I didn't go when you guys drove up to San Francisco.

00:01:58.015 --> 00:02:02.836
No, no, no, but this is when you guys went to see Maki and...

00:02:02.807 --> 00:02:03.920
work.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.878
And I didn't even go on that trip.

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:18.703
 Like, Santa Cruz or something?

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:23.645
Okay, cause I did didn't go on that because my pastor.

00:02:22.906 --> 00:02:26.028
passed away and I had to do all that.

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:33.924
Yeah, he passed away and we were having the funeral on the day.

00:02:36.845 --> 00:02:42.296
But, I heard that trip was a little crazy, and then the big bear one was crazy.

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:43.008
to see.

00:02:46.682 --> 00:02:49.706
Yeah, yeah that one.

00:02:50.294 --> 00:02:53.013
Yeah, I did too. I did too.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.505
I don't think they could have snowboarded or skied. Hehehe.

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:06.493
Yea, like sledding or something I think.

00:03:09.868 --> 00:03:12.974
They were only like four.

00:03:13.581 --> 00:03:16.684
Yeah, they were really tiny still.

00:03:17.424 --> 00:03:20.095
Yeah. So.

00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:22.976
Yeah. But um...

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.334
but that one was a little crazy.

00:03:27.334 --> 00:03:32.093
It was, well, yeah, all the trips were fun. The cruise was crazy.

00:03:37.932 --> 00:03:41.368
Yeah, it was, it was.

00:03:40.976 --> 00:03:43.685
Like, we had, she had to plan for all.

00:03:43.685 --> 00:03:48.673
54 people that went on the cruise. It is...

00:03:48.282 --> 00:03:50.351
Oh gosh.

00:03:51.988 --> 00:03:55.389
Did you get sick on that trip?

00:03:56.291 --> 00:04:00.155
Yeah, but on the cruise were you still okay?

00:04:00.155 --> 00:04:03.076
As you got home, right?

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.674
Yeah.

00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:12.273
I was feeling something the day before that.

00:04:12.273 --> 00:04:17.200
My throat was gone. Like it was...

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.754
And did Sandy survive that one?

00:04:28.928 --> 00:04:33.737
I'm vaccinated for a lot of stuff, but I was out.

00:04:33.737 --> 00:04:36.843
My throat. Something about my throat.

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:41.433
It was really much yeah i was able to get over it in like a day.

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:46.525
Would you go if we have another family?

00:04:45.937 --> 00:04:49.440

00:04:58.021 --> 00:05:02.088
