WEBVTT

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.138
Yeah...

00:00:21.743 --> 00:00:22.906
That was a cool airplane

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.129
No, I think that's the one in the front.

00:00:32.222 --> 00:00:35.631
No, it was in the back. Actually, I don't remember.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:40.334
But then like they're like yeah, so those were like kind of like a classic kind of playing but then at that time

00:00:40.378 --> 00:00:42.891
It was like a very  good play

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:44.089
Yeah...

00:00:44.328 --> 00:00:47.433
Yeah... much more like if they get more like efficient one than the

00:00:47.477 --> 00:00:51.021
Yeah, apparently yeah

00:00:56.438 --> 00:01:00.927
probably yeah yeah yeah it was like invented and then like you know

00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:07.813
Well, I guess everyone was helping out and then some people looked for those planes and then they, you know, found one.

00:01:13.262 --> 00:01:17.870
Yeah, he was one of those some pilots. yeah..

00:01:18.814 --> 00:01:21.043
Yeah... He used that skill too.

00:01:22.855 --> 00:01:24.106
Yeah...

00:01:27.117 --> 00:01:29.614
He's the mechanic.

00:01:29.614 --> 00:01:32.989
He was the only guy they could never have a six

00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:40.837
It wasn't good enough to fly it.

00:01:42.278 --> 00:01:43.661
Yeah...

00:01:46.522 --> 00:01:47.941
I don't know, I didn't watch that part.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.737
Yeah... yeah..

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.852
Yeah...

00:02:00.376 --> 00:02:02.977
First attack and I think it just went back into the ocean.

00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:06.341
Yeah...

00:02:08.663 --> 00:02:11.835
I don't know. In another Godzilla, like... big..

00:02:11.835 --> 00:02:15.818
The reason it went back is because it suddenly overheated.

00:02:17.775 --> 00:02:22.771
No.. no.., she  the last.  she was  the last. Like when it was like number...

00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:26.854
numbers like when I was in a like third stage

00:02:26.854 --> 00:02:30.888
like it suddenly overheated so I had to go back into the ocean

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:32.644
Yeah...

00:02:33.483 --> 00:02:34.558
Yeah...

00:02:35.712 --> 00:02:39.087
You only saw like part of it.

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:44.235
Ha.. ha... Yeah, and then destroy everything. Yeah, that's cool.

00:02:44.235 --> 00:02:48.793
yeah but anyway back to the main yeah

00:02:54.824 --> 00:02:56.491
Yeah...

00:02:56.992 --> 00:02:59.236
It was like classic.

00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:03.194
Yeah, kinda. Yeah, kinda... Yeah..

00:03:03.106 --> 00:03:08.102
The really old ones had kinder expressions. Yeah, much more round.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.890
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:19.151
Yeah, and it does that, and it does that. What do you call it?

00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:24.146
What does that mean? Like, Why are they called shea?

00:03:27.718 --> 00:03:29.431
Yeah...

00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:31.955
Ahhh...

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.594
Yeah...

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.622
Yeah...

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:43.449
Ahhhh...So that's why they have that.

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.385
yeah yeah yeah

00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:50.758
yeah yeah yeah that makes sense

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.305
Yeah, they were a bit comedic. (***)

00:03:57.305 --> 00:03:59.735
Yeah, they were gone.

00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:06.586
Yeah, they don't use their hands all the time.

00:04:06.586 --> 00:04:06.753
you.

00:04:10.788 --> 00:04:13.723
Yeah, that's why the newer one is a projector of people.

00:04:13.723 --> 00:04:18.717
So you say that newer ones are too nice, but the minus one wasn't nice.

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:18.786
you

00:04:25.848 --> 00:04:27.406
What

00:04:28.826 --> 00:04:33.704
My last one was like that. But then the older ones were like, they were Japan.

00:04:33.704 --> 00:04:38.699
but it kind of yeah but then like the american godzilla is the one that kind of

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.893
like protector but

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.846
Yeah...

00:04:46.108 --> 00:04:50.411
Ginga monsters. Ginga monsters.

00:04:50.478 --> 00:04:53.381
King of monsters.

00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:57.920
Ha.. ha.. ha..  Kick a monster. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.915
That was (***)   a good one, but then like...

00:05:02.915 --> 00:05:07.858
Yeah, but then I think minus one is good because they just step on the people.

00:05:07.858 --> 00:05:10.322
 go.. no mercy.

00:05:14.276 --> 00:05:15.615
No...

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.115
No...

00:05:21.831 --> 00:05:25.189
I think maybe because it was the closest blend mask.

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:27.805
Not yet.. Yeah...

00:05:30.708 --> 00:05:33.795
That's only the comedic one. That's only the comedic one.

00:05:36.951 --> 00:05:37.862
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:41.509
Yeah...

00:05:42.012 --> 00:05:43.262
Yeah...

00:05:46.502 --> 00:05:48.814
That was the shingles that you're talking about

00:05:49.903 --> 00:05:51.155
Yeah...

00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:53.709
I guess.

00:05:55.572 --> 00:05:57.086
Yeah...   Yeah...

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.492
Yeah...   Yeah...

00:06:01.422 --> 00:06:02.913
Yeah...

00:06:03.716 --> 00:06:05.033
Yeah...

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.321
Yeah...

00:06:11.093 --> 00:06:12.586
Yeah...

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.694
Yeah.. Yeaah..

00:06:13.678 --> 00:06:14.535
Him
