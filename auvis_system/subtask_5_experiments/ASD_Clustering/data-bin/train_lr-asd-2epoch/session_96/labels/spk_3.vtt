WEBVTT

00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:14.020
Right...

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:19.322
Okay...

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.555
So what do you think about the airplane they used? 

00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:27.639
They had a propeller in the back, one propeller in the back, right?

00:00:30.575 --> 00:00:35.284
Was it in the front? Wasn't it?

00:00:42.304 --> 00:00:45.375
Yeah...  It's very aerodynamic.

00:00:47.382 --> 00:00:50.589
That one that they were using for the war.

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.583
So apparently they hid that thing from everybody.

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:59.195
No one knew they had that kind of airplane.

00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:03.330
How did they find out that the airplane is there?

00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:11.936
And then he is probably the only guy who can...

00:01:11.936 --> 00:01:14.433
Ride that type of airplane

00:01:15.052 --> 00:01:17.870
Pilots... Yeah.. Yeah..

00:01:17.893 --> 00:01:22.702
So he used that skill to kind of fly that thing.

00:01:22.702 --> 00:01:25.824
What about the guy who was so mad at him?

00:01:25.824 --> 00:01:27.849
You know that guy who came out?

00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:29.744
Hmm...

00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:37.721
Okay, because the airplane that when they found it, it was not.

00:01:37.721 --> 00:01:39.459
Operatable.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.830
To fix it before they can fly.

00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:46.895
And how long did they take to fix that thing?

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.541
Ohhhh...

00:01:49.887 --> 00:01:54.376
Well, for the sake of the movie, I'm sure it wasn't too many days.

00:01:55.575 --> 00:02:00.248
and Godzilla was also coming back. Did Godzilla retreat after the first attack?

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.619
Okay, and then they came. So why did I have to go back?

00:02:16.652 --> 00:02:21.410
in Gojira? Gojira was overheated? Oh Shin Gojira?

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:27.935
Uh hung..

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.965
oh to cool off yeah oh that's funny

00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:38.690
actually i didn't really see the entire shingojira i only saw the one that was like

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.406
That part and then

00:02:41.406 --> 00:02:45.052
The heeel the part...Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:47.245 --> 00:02:48.494
Yeah.. minus one.

00:02:49.588 --> 00:02:50.516
So...

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:54.805
So do you feel the face?

00:02:54.805 --> 00:02:58.266
Of that minus one  Bujiraa...

00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:01.589
It was classic, but it was mean, like no facial expression.

00:03:01.612 --> 00:03:03.468
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:06.332 --> 00:03:09.267
Rub more round yeah and then actually you could tell

00:03:09.267 --> 00:03:11.968
When the Godzilla is smiling, you can tell it.

00:03:11.968 --> 00:03:16.743
Godzilla was happy he jumps around you know and then

00:03:16.743 --> 00:03:19.274
Give them the Pollock pose (***)

00:03:19.274 --> 00:03:24.269
It's like one of those

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.122
I think it came from one of the

00:03:27.122 --> 00:03:30.277
comedians in Japan was doing that.

00:03:30.277 --> 00:03:35.272
like at that time they were using that to kind of either like surprise

00:03:35.272 --> 00:03:37.971
or something like that.

00:03:37.971 --> 00:03:41.549
That move became very popular at that time.

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.173
so it was not even from the godzilla it was came from the

00:03:46.173 --> 00:03:49.717
Things that he was kind of well known at that time Yeah.. yeah.. yeah... 

00:03:49.717 --> 00:03:54.239
So basically Godzilla was turning into Canadian a little.

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.354
Yeah.

00:03:56.332 --> 00:04:01.326
Yeah, no, they were. And they act basically just like humans.

00:04:01.326 --> 00:04:02.643
Basically.

00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:10.271
and they didn't really just come to destroy they're actually becoming like protector of

00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:11.385
People

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.689
Yeah... Yeah...

00:04:16.397 --> 00:04:21.374
yeah they are nice no but anything that japan made

00:04:21.352 --> 00:04:24.035
or is not nice.

00:04:24.058 --> 00:04:28.749
They were the destroyer, or at least the Shin Godzilla was like that.

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:31.821
And then minus one is like that... and then..

00:04:31.843 --> 00:04:36.314
Now all the ones they totally different like that..

00:04:40.174 --> 00:04:44.155
started to become more, although the Boston in the

00:04:45.208 --> 00:04:46.202
The..

00:04:47.446 --> 00:04:49.961
No.. no.. What is the title of the movie? 

00:04:49.938 --> 00:04:52.453
No.. no.. The  King of Monsters

00:04:52.475 --> 00:04:57.470
So you say Kika Monster. What is Kika Monster? King of Monsters. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.997
I mean that was pretty cool. I like King of Monsters.

00:05:02.197 --> 00:05:03.368
Yeah...

00:05:04.315 --> 00:05:05.530
Yeah...

00:05:08.254 --> 00:05:11.662
yeah no mercy well do you even...

00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:16.174
Gojira even no risk   humans when he was on the land.

00:05:16.218 --> 00:05:20.285
yeah what do you think he was thinking when he came out

00:05:20.285 --> 00:05:21.568
Start jacking...

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:27.862
Okay, so do you think the Godzilla was coming?

00:05:27.862 --> 00:05:30.528
to Tokyo just sightseeing maybe?

00:05:30.528 --> 00:05:33.970
Just like other jokes? Yeah, yeah, yeah... Ohh...

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.324
But he just strike starat to destroy everything.

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:42.645
Remember Uncle Mal said that the...

00:05:42.645 --> 00:05:47.470
that God's Godzilla was a symbol of chaos

00:05:48.602 --> 00:05:52.482
Yeah. Was that shingles,? Or, I thought minus one was two... Yeah..

00:05:54.441 --> 00:05:59.436
But Shingojira, oh I see. So Shingojira was the one who made, okay.

00:05:59.436 --> 00:06:01.629
Yeah..  So..

00:06:02.203 --> 00:06:06.607
So that's something that you can think of.. Umm...   

00:06:06.607 --> 00:06:11.163
what about what about other guys that

00:06:11.163 --> 00:06:16.158
you know the captain of the boat yeah...   So do you think..?

00:06:16.158 --> 00:06:16.259
