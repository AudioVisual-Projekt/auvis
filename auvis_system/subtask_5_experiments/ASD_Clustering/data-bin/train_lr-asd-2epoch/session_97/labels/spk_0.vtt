WEBVTT

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:16.021
Okay...

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:21.848
 So many....

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:23.188
Hmm...

00:00:23.277 --> 00:00:26.922
I am very like  .. hard to find his...

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:29.774
I guess they kinda look like Hollywood guys. (***)

00:00:31.428 --> 00:00:35.056
Like a yogurt. You know how they switch their flavors? (***)

00:00:35.056 --> 00:00:40.050
Usually around Valentine's Day, I should go now to see if they have something.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.290
(***) red velvet (***)

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.185
frozen yogurt and then i think dairy queen

00:00:48.185 --> 00:00:51.914
Will have like a red velvet blusher

00:00:51.914 --> 00:00:55.305
I love it...

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:58.006
And in those stories, what's the only cause? (***) 

00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:01.904
Somebody told me that red velvet is like a version of chocolate cake.

00:01:01.904 --> 00:01:05.886
It's a titan. (***) 

00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:09.969
Family ... Yeah...

00:01:12.737 --> 00:01:15.927
Ha.. ha.. I love ice cream.

00:01:17.024 --> 00:01:21.935
I love cheese, but I can't have a lot of it.

00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:24.786
Because.. Then  I  get too...too sweet

00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:27.807
And I... (***)

00:01:27.807 --> 00:01:32.210
I like this one thing my mom taught me how to make, it's so easy and so good

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.037
I even won a contest at my friend's house. Yeah..

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.653
That was good.

00:01:41.307 --> 00:01:44.918
Square..One square of Philadelphia cream cheese.

00:01:44.918 --> 00:01:49.912
And then one cans of condensed milk ego brand

00:01:49.912 --> 00:01:53.912
And then.. teaspoon of vanilla

00:01:53.912 --> 00:01:57.067
And then.. (***) 

00:01:59.093 --> 00:02:01.439
I don't know what to say. (***)

00:02:01.574 --> 00:02:03.633
And so..

00:02:03.738 --> 00:02:05.734
(***)

00:02:05.742 --> 00:02:08.239
How many  put it in a brown cracker crust.

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.834
Oh, it's pie. Yeah, throw it in the freezer.

00:02:12.474 --> 00:02:16.677
(***)

00:02:16.677 --> 00:02:19.595
You have a seat. 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.385
Yeah, I can write it down because it's really easy.

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:29.614
And to get the ingredients, it's probably like $10.

00:02:31.948 --> 00:02:35.863
Do you like to bake?

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.033
Hmm...

00:02:44.756 --> 00:02:45.331
Ha..

00:02:51.542 --> 00:02:53.688
Ha, ha, ha...

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.142
Ohhhh...

00:02:57.515 --> 00:03:02.510
Another one I really like

00:03:02.576 --> 00:03:07.571
I always get this for my birthdays. Yellow cake and chocolate frosting.

00:03:07.505 --> 00:03:07.571
you

00:03:13.477 --> 00:03:17.696
No...  it's like you buy it and it's like chrome.

00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:21.217
Crocker or Pillsbury and then they have the Frostbite

00:03:21.172 --> 00:03:23.704
It's really easy.

00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:27.434
Yeah, but then I didn't run her down, I fell back down too.(***)

00:03:27.456 --> 00:03:32.451
But if you put soda in it, like a can of soda, put it in the microwave, it'll cook.

00:03:34.774 --> 00:03:39.516
Yeah, you should google it. It's like soda cake or something.

00:03:39.516 --> 00:03:43.549
You can make it in like 30 minutes or something.

00:03:44.253 --> 00:03:45.359
Yeah...

00:03:48.705 --> 00:03:50.032
Yeah...

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.958
Ha..ha..

00:03:58.861 --> 00:04:00.520
Ohhhh...

00:04:02.685 --> 00:04:07.494
You know what, a bullet journal, instead of having lines in it,

00:04:07.494 --> 00:04:12.489
has the dots. You can use those to draw.

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.367
and you can make like your own calendar or whatever

00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:20.033
Won thing..so much time and

00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:22.952
(***)

00:04:22.952 --> 00:04:27.592
(***) and stickers. I just love  that. I just (***) a little girl

00:04:27.592 --> 00:04:32.555
I don't know what state this is in and like you can track, keep track of like

00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:35.541
 Your moods or your house

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:38.055
a military missile (***)

00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:40.744
You can put a lot of stuff in there

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.990
And it's just fun because you switch it up. The one thing that's hard about it...

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.986
You want it to be perfect. But sometimes you'll mess up a line.

00:04:49.986 --> 00:04:52.837
You know and it's just not gonna be perfect and you're like...

00:04:52.837 --> 00:04:55.656
Oh wow, like a cat changing.

00:04:55.656 --> 00:05:00.651
It's already out there and you don't have a big old whiteout.

00:05:00.651 --> 00:05:03.587
I like it

00:05:03.587 --> 00:05:06.709
Can I use a simplified version for Word to like...

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:08.988
Like I put my tasks on there.

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:14.438
And then whatever task that I didn't finish that week, I'll put it to the next week.

00:05:14.438 --> 00:05:18.336
(***)

00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:23.330
But I just think it was all these washi tapes.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.673
to basically recharge both of them. And this one...(***)

00:05:26.673 --> 00:05:30.233
It's kind of expensive (***) directly

00:05:30.233 --> 00:05:33.558
And they have beautiful washi tape.

00:05:33.558 --> 00:05:37.490
Ha..ha.. You report..

00:05:41.353 --> 00:05:43.935
I love Daiso washi tape.

00:05:46.382 --> 00:05:47.176
Yeah.

00:05:57.875 --> 00:06:02.801
It looks like it's tall. It's like a dollar so you can't eat it.

00:06:02.801 --> 00:06:06.092
Really? There was a time when I was really making

00:06:06.092 --> 00:06:08.945
(***)

00:06:08.945 --> 00:06:13.940
and then I used washi tape and marbles to decorate it.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.606
I put them in a thing so when I take it out.
