00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.477
Wait, this is kind of straight. Yeah.

00:00:49.255 --> 00:00:53.034
No, actually but I went to like a winter camp 

00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:56.410
thing over the winter and there were people from Israel.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.286
And so, they were. I- I was just kind of like blew my mind because they were like

00:01:01.286 --> 00:01:04.873
Yeah, I listen to like hip hop, like Hebrew pop.

00:01:05.624 --> 00:01:09.185
I was like, wow, there's like a whole world out there. Like... Yeah.

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:12.188
I mean, I didn't listen to anything because I would not understand.

00:01:12.188 --> 00:01:17.528
Just to think that there's like, for each country, there's probably like, there's like, one hip-hop like...

00:01:17.725 --> 00:01:19.292
hip-hop

00:01:20.438 --> 00:01:24.405
Yeah, it's all your by the way. Next number. Yeah.

00:01:41.686 --> 00:01:42.852
Oh, yeah.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.170
Yeah. 

00:01:51.227 --> 00:01:52.373
Really?

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:56.195
Oh...

00:02:27.602 --> 00:02:29.922
You guys are talking about the same thing.

00:02:33.874 --> 00:02:35.448
Business trip.

00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:37.788
Gamelan? What's Gamelan?

00:02:56.087 --> 00:03:00.006
Oh! I remember that's still on.

00:03:02.196 --> 00:03:05.137
I know, I know exactly what you're thinking about. 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.991
Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, I know that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:11.742 --> 00:03:16.737
I think we've all seen it in like an instrument tube, but it's like a steel metal. 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:46.107
Road music there was something. Oh, like Indian?

00:03:46.107 --> 00:03:49.513
That's pretty cool. Also, they're like...

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:24.374
Oh yeah, their their tonality is completely different then.

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:27.195
Also their level of like...

00:04:27.432 --> 00:04:31.300
Accuracy in their tones when they sing is like out of this world.

00:04:33.176 --> 00:04:34.125
Yeah. 

00:04:37.347 --> 00:04:39.123
Um... I think I was going to say that.

00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:04.624
No! A lot of it. Okay, I know it's interesting but okay

00:05:04.664 --> 00:05:09.422
Also they're like, it actually sounds like auto tune when they sing.

00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:10.525
Like...

00:05:12.303 --> 00:05:15.071

00:06:04.193 --> 00:06:07.467
