WEBVTT

00:00:21.632 --> 00:00:22.202
So...

00:00:22.297 --> 00:00:26.854
So I got the job and I moved over here and I've been here ever since.

00:00:26.854 --> 00:00:28.034
And I love it.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.207
Who would have built with a shelter for

00:00:35.207 --> 00:00:38.248
um look like a traffic cue.

00:00:39.847 --> 00:00:42.649
So kinda coord with code red.

00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:46.801
No, it was uh for youth, so 18 and 24.

00:00:48.285 --> 00:00:52.015
Yeah. Yeah, something like that. So...

00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:53.045
Um...

00:00:54.174 --> 00:00:58.213
Then I've just been living here ever since and I love it. Yeah.

00:01:31.408 --> 00:01:32.179
Yeah.

00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:35.381
Yeah.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.080
Yeah.

00:01:37.105 --> 00:01:41.155
I'm not very thrifty. I'm use to it for a while, I was paycheck to paycheck.

00:01:42.327 --> 00:01:44.264
Just getting adjusted too.

00:01:45.302 --> 00:01:48.799
But, you know, it was crazy because when I moved over here

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:52.090
again, for the second time, I wouldn't

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.376
less money than I was in Arizona. So

00:01:57.213 --> 00:01:58.093
Yes.

00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:03.482
Yeah.

00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:06.873
Where did you go to, Arizona?

00:02:10.855 --> 00:02:11.683
Okay.

00:02:17.891 --> 00:02:19.161
Oh, okay.

00:02:23.932 --> 00:02:28.023
Where? It's in Gilbert as well? It's in Chandler, okay.

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:30.718
Okay.

00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:34.549
Okay.

00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:43.966
Oh, okay.

00:02:46.906 --> 00:02:49.300
I'm thinking a celebrity like...

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:53.476
Uh-huh.

00:03:03.432 --> 00:03:04.711
Did you guys get to do the...

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.774
Did you get to the do live rock?

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.500
Yeah.

00:03:16.874 --> 00:03:17.645
Oh.

00:03:20.211 --> 00:03:22.979
Yes, on the walls and stuff, how they have them.

00:03:44.085 --> 00:03:46.638
I remember drawing when I was 14.

00:03:47.107 --> 00:03:50.198
And that slide rock is stuck in my head all these years.

00:03:50.198 --> 00:03:54.079
Um... Flagstaff is really nice.

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.602
And the It's so beautiful. It's um

00:03:58.602 --> 00:04:00.749
Do you go, when it was winter or summer?

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.884
Oh. Snow?

00:04:07.283 --> 00:04:08.221
Okay.

00:04:23.163 --> 00:04:23.833
Wow.

00:04:34.764 --> 00:04:37.785
Oh my gosh, that's so crazy.

00:04:37.785 --> 00:04:41.379
Did you guys get a bowl? I haven't been there since they did this but...

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.519
What is it called though? That walkway,

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:46.881
clear and you can walk across it.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.833
Oh.

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:00.162
Right.

00:05:05.887 --> 00:05:06.459
Okay.

00:05:15.601 --> 00:05:16.381
Okay.

00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:26.489
Yeah.

00:05:31.684 --> 00:05:32.915
Would you do it though?

00:05:35.747 --> 00:05:36.787
Me, neither.

00:05:41.463 --> 00:05:44.494
For me, I wouldn't go just for the fear, like

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.255
The fear of it. Yeah. Like, I get really panicked.

00:06:01.331 --> 00:06:03.102
crime with a prime target.

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:07.763
I went...

00:06:08.708 --> 00:06:11.795
I've been with family. But family vacations to

00:06:11.762 --> 00:06:15.880
drive by it. And I think the last time I went I was like fifteen.

00:06:15.913 --> 00:06:20.551
But when I was 11 and 12, or no, 12 and 13, I did this

00:06:20.518 --> 00:06:21.334
program...
