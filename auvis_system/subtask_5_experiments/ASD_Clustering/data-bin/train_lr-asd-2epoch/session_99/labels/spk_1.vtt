WEBVTT

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:30.366
Okay.

00:00:32.077 --> 00:00:35.705
Um so we're talking about favorite side characters.

00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:38.012
and favorite creatures.

00:00:41.334 --> 00:00:44.998
Yeah, which theme? Yeah. What topic?

00:00:51.257 --> 00:00:51.964
Yeah.

00:00:54.874 --> 00:00:55.680
Yeah.

00:00:57.377 --> 00:00:58.102
Yeah.

00:01:00.022 --> 00:01:00.828
Yeah.

00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:09.437
yeah 

00:01:11.287 --> 00:01:14.089
Well, they kind of go sideways sometimes.

00:01:14.652 --> 00:01:18.071
They usually go sideways. They neither.

00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:22.881
Yeah, they usually go sideways. After the younger ones. Younger ones.

00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.032
yeah 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.541
Hagerstown.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.402
You don't want to live anywhere else.

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.307
Yeah, but then like it's always like so um how do you say it?

00:01:46.516 --> 00:01:49.998
How do you say it like... Uh so

00:01:49.998 --> 00:01:53.864
um uh high power that I think I prefer

00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:57.271
like so much like, like elegance and stuff like that.

00:01:57.191 --> 00:02:00.263
Like so much, so much like formality.

00:02:00.343 --> 00:02:05.322
I prefer, like, if we're gonna do that, then I'll just said Hobbit. And just do you...

00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:07.195
And then...

00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:12.325
No.

00:02:15.306 --> 00:02:15.991
Yeah.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.552
Dwarves do the gymnastic a lot.

00:02:23.123 --> 00:02:24.794
Dwarves are always. Yeah.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.443
Uh I don't know. I kind of like, just like... uh Never mind, anyway, no. uh...

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.327
Yeah, but they're so hard to use. They're so hard to use, though.

00:02:48.842 --> 00:02:52.267
I would, but then I kinda like Axe too. Axe seems kinda strong.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.745
But then, I guess in the end the sword is the most powerful.

00:03:03.557 --> 00:03:06.661
Yeah. They, they all, they, they, yeah.

00:03:06.661 --> 00:03:10.122
They only, only runs out at the part of the climax.

00:03:10.458 --> 00:03:15.735
Yeah, but they like, oh, I think we can run that out to make it harder for the character. Okay, let's make it run out.

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.509
But then, but then, if they run out of...

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:22.391
For now, they have these two knives that can come out of their back.

00:03:24.163 --> 00:03:25.656
And then do a few throws.

00:03:26.743 --> 00:03:30.506
I remember, remember in the movie where like the elf

00:03:30.506 --> 00:03:34.641
defeats the big um elephant thing? That's cool.

00:03:34.641 --> 00:03:37.154
And then, and then the guy keeps looking back.

00:03:37.154 --> 00:03:42.149
And all, all the other people are being, being trapped by the arrows. And they 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:45.171
That's the only scene where they had the classic scream.

00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:47.922
the classic. They have a classic scream. They had...

00:03:47.922 --> 00:03:51.768
uh there's probably at least 200 movies that have the classic scream.

00:04:01.062 --> 00:04:01.908
Yeah.

00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:08.602
Yeah.

00:04:12.196 --> 00:04:12.961
Yeah.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.524
Yeah they're was like but I kind of like ax because

00:04:16.524 --> 00:04:19.926
If it hits, it delivers the most hardest chuck.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.522
Yeah. And then you can kind of use that as a shield too.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.424
I guess, but usually the big ones. Those kind, like that.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.496
Yeah.

00:04:35.836 --> 00:04:39.067
Funko Pop. A lot of them.

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.972
Those like. Oh, but then like this

00:04:41.972 --> 00:04:46.376
It's a little different, but in the Hobbit the movie, remember that was humongous.

00:04:46.376 --> 00:04:49.532
Um, crossbow. crossbo...

00:04:49.532 --> 00:04:53.365
I guess crossbow. Yeah, the giant crossbow.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.763
Giant crossbow. But I like giant crossbows too. But then, yeah, catapults are good.

00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:01.034
Oh, how about Battering Ram?

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:05.343
Battering rams. They use battering rams.

00:05:05.343 --> 00:05:07.968
Or, Orcs always use the battering ram.

00:05:15.621 --> 00:05:18.119
Yeah, they use it. Use it all the time.

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:22.742
But I guess like the most, one of the most useful kind of weapon, it might be a siege tower.

00:05:23.547 --> 00:05:25.266
Yeah, they're useful.

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:30.824
Yeah, you can hit them all you want, but then he's a pretty arrow, I remember.

00:05:30.824 --> 00:05:34.251
Okay, then don't make it on foot. Don't make it on foot.

00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:36.884
You have to make it a metal, otherwise it'll just break.

00:05:36.884 --> 00:05:39.432
There's definitely orcs in the air.

00:05:39.432 --> 00:05:43.431
And they're like, hey, look, a bunch of Orcs. Your call. Okay. Yeah.

00:05:50.737 --> 00:05:51.422
mmh

00:05:51.463 --> 00:05:55.091
Like after they fix it up, maybe a lift down.

00:05:55.091 --> 00:06:00.086
Oh not lift down, like fail. Yeah. They fixed it up, right?

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.517
Yeah.

00:06:06.886 --> 00:06:09.857
But I don't know, I'm kind of like, um, Lothlòrien too.

00:06:09.857 --> 00:06:12.641
But then, like, if you could just...

00:06:12.641 --> 00:06:15.256
Live peacefully? Maybe like Baron's house.

00:06:15.256 --> 00:06:18.614
You know the the... Yeah, Mirkwood.

00:06:18.614 --> 00:06:22.058
I don't know. I wouldn't want to live with that I guess, but...

00:06:24.487 --> 00:06:28.251
and all the mushrooms and all the mushrooms
