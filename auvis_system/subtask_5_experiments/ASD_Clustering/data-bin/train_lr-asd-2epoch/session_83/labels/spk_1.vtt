WEBVTT

00:00:21.728 --> 00:00:22.387
Yes.

00:00:25.744 --> 00:00:29.878
Uh I'm going to Hong Kong and China.

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:31.332
At the end of this month.

00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:37.944
No. That's in Japan in April. Yeah. So this are new.

00:00:38.214 --> 00:00:41.623
like i decided uh I think like three weeks ago.

00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:43.447
Friend. Yeah.

00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:49.218
Yeah. I could tell you the reason too why we decided to book it so quick. this time uh

00:00:49.218 --> 00:00:52.879
the end of January.

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:57.553
Um This was back in November. And um

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.245
She had to go into orientation on January 24th.

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:05.603
and um i thought it was gonna be like those like

00:01:05.603 --> 00:01:09.011
For like two months? Yeah. It turned out to be a federal jury.

00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:11.947
It's a high. High profile case.

00:01:12.285 --> 00:01:16.015
Yeah, yeah. And so I was hoping that I

00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:21.009
I was hoping that I didn't get to choose. But um luckily I got chosen.

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.524
ultimate jury so

00:01:23.524 --> 00:01:28.518
I have to be honest though. The official is like 6 months are good.

00:01:28.518 --> 00:01:32.535
But it take a year. Yeah. They go back

00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:36.366
Where um... they start from the number one.

00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:40.771
all the way up to the ....

00:01:41.714 --> 00:01:45.140
Yeah, so I'm in, I'm in the middle where I'm like

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.056
so um if you're like more of

00:01:49.056 --> 00:01:52.178
31/40 and you have good chance to being called then.

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:55.417
I mean, like the best so decline or might not.

00:01:55.417 --> 00:01:59.670
they called me. It also like depends on...

00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:03.603
and how they got excused. Yeah. 

00:02:03.603 --> 00:02:06.774
So, so that I got the chance and I like it

00:02:06.774 --> 00:02:10.741
And so I decided to, like, I had to talk to my friend and

00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:14.824
we both wanted to go to like an 

00:02:14.824 --> 00:02:19.819
I told him it might be better just case everybody now to go on

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.772
trip as earlier and as possible.

00:02:22.772 --> 00:02:25.675
there's are might be a missing joke where I might

00:02:25.675 --> 00:02:30.484
could be middle or end of it. so that's why we scheduled that like

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:35.479
like um late this month or early of next month.

00:02:35.883 --> 00:02:36.797
So...

00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:47.140
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Although there, there was uh

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.734
They gave us a sheet uh where you could put

00:02:50.734 --> 00:02:54.243
of which states are not available to do that. So they

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.003
They knew, they know that a lot of people already have vacation schedules. they

00:02:59.036 --> 00:03:03.408
which date, to which state they  are not available to do that.

00:03:03.408 --> 00:03:06.681
So I put all my unavailable date on here because

00:03:06.681 --> 00:03:10.713
I have like a few trips coming up throughout the year, so...

00:03:10.713 --> 00:03:14.780
Yeah, that's why we scheduled this trip at the end of this month.

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.565
so I'm going, yeah

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:20.619

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:23.403
