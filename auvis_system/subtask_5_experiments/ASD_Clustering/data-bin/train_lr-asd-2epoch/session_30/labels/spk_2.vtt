00:00:31.426 --> 00:00:34.211
Bean pastes?

00:00:34.211 --> 00:00:39.205

00:01:11.876 --> 00:01:16.380

00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:54.282
oh yeah

00:01:54.282 --> 00:01:56.814
Yeah, that's fascinating. I've never heard of that.

00:01:56.814 --> 00:02:00.374
I didn't know they had glasses too.

00:02:06.112 --> 00:02:08.440
oh

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:12.523
oh

00:02:14.077 --> 00:02:16.254
oh really

00:02:19.663 --> 00:02:22.345
oh

00:02:22.346 --> 00:02:25.754
It's something that came from Korea.

00:02:25.753 --> 00:02:28.252
You got to go like this.

00:02:40.148 --> 00:02:43.422
Oh Okay. wow

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.754
Yes.

00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:51.606
wow That sounds like delicious, too.

00:02:51.606 --> 00:02:55.369
But I'm sure it's pretty. 

00:02:58.121 --> 00:03:02.306
oh okay

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.952
yes

00:03:06.928 --> 00:03:09.713
oh

00:03:09.713 --> 00:03:12.261
Interesting.

00:03:12.261 --> 00:03:17.257
Ummm baking not neccessarily

00:03:17.257 --> 00:03:21.188
Cookies? I do. (***)

00:03:21.188 --> 00:03:25.593
But when I do everyday cooking, it's just so routine for me.

00:03:25.593 --> 00:03:30.553
that I don't consider it much of a hobby but um..

00:03:30.553 --> 00:03:35.059
I did get into, you know, once you start thinking about...

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:37.827
how you can make certain things from scratch.

00:03:37.827 --> 00:03:42.688
You know, it gets a little more interesting. Just make it a little more healthy.

00:03:42.688 --> 00:03:46.974
try to get (***) That's interesting to me.

00:03:46.974 --> 00:03:50.383
and

00:03:50.383 --> 00:03:52.896
Just like...

00:03:52.896 --> 00:03:57.200
Maybe like a pasta as you're talking about the sauces and things like that.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.984
just something on your own..

00:03:59.984 --> 00:04:04.979
Rather than, you know, buy something, you know, if you make it from scratch, it'll taste better.

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.493
and umm

00:04:07.493 --> 00:04:11.982
But it is a little more time consuming and labor intensive.

00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:16.235
You know, I feel the deterrence when you don't get into it.

00:04:16.235 --> 00:04:18.748
that much but um...

00:04:18.748 --> 00:04:22.022
But yeah, that's something like that.

00:04:22.022 --> 00:04:24.538
I would like to do too.

00:04:24.538 --> 00:04:28.806
But I guess my other hobby would be, I mean if you call it a hobby.

00:04:28.806 --> 00:04:31.489
It seems like everyone wants to travel too.

00:04:31.489 --> 00:04:35.303
That's definitely something that I do enjoy.

00:04:35.303 --> 00:04:40.299
i am attracted to more Traveling now

00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:44.989
As they get older, it's like, oh, I guess I need to make some time.

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:48.094
My wife isn't as demanding. 

00:04:48.094 --> 00:04:51.436
You're so accustomed to it.

00:04:51.436 --> 00:04:56.094
Oh, I know what I want to do sometime to do something stuff little more

00:04:56.094 --> 00:05:00.784
So me and my husband, we've been trying to do a little more traveling.

00:05:00.784 --> 00:05:03.602
It's actually Japan, right?

00:05:03.602 --> 00:05:08.395
he wanted to go to .....

00:05:08.395 --> 00:05:11.044
phedophillas

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:14.623
Oh really?

00:05:14.623 --> 00:05:17.137
Yes, she's in Tokyo right now.

00:05:17.137 --> 00:05:20.073
That's the end of South Portal.

00:05:20.073 --> 00:05:23.195
(***)

00:05:23.195 --> 00:05:28.106
We've never been to San Juan. That was always on his wish list to go to.

00:05:28.106 --> 00:05:31.008
and umm..

00:05:31.008 --> 00:05:34.130
no i think no i actually declined though

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.286
i wasn't asked..

00:05:37.286 --> 00:05:40.710
Not really. It's cold weather, that's why.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.351
So that was like the....yesyes.

00:05:45.351 --> 00:05:50.025
and it happened to be right now is like the most busiest time of an hour

00:05:50.025 --> 00:05:52.590
And I just thought it's so hard to take off 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.017
If it was a different time, I couldn't take it.

00:05:56.017 --> 00:05:59.121
and I know he's wishing to go

00:05:59.122 --> 00:06:02.683
and he asked me realistically what I would do.

00:06:02.683 --> 00:06:06.513
be able to go, you know, and push it off a year or two.

00:06:06.513 --> 00:06:11.289
And I'm really looking at, and realistically, I think, no, I won't be able to.

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.710
It's just, you know, this is like really one of the worst times to go. It's just why I choose my job.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.541
you know
