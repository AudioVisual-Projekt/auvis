WEBVTT

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.506
Oh. Northern miles. Yeah, yeah.

00:00:20.635 --> 00:00:23.504
Yeah, yeah, how about you?

00:00:30.178 --> 00:00:34.641
Yeah. But that's not an issue with us, though, because we all have passports.

00:00:39.723 --> 00:00:42.233
uhumm

00:00:49.492 --> 00:00:53.473
Like what. When did you go, like what season? 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.298
It was a summer?

00:00:56.941 --> 00:00:59.733
 It is?

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.481
Wait, during midwinter you can travel through Alaska like that?

00:01:02.114 --> 00:01:05.489
I thought was heavily restricted

00:01:14.883 --> 00:01:16.838
Okay.

00:01:22.267 --> 00:01:27.579
Oh, crap that, that's a trick.

00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:02.612
Okay, Okay.

00:02:02.612 --> 00:02:06.892
I heard another good place to look at the Northern Lights is Greenland.

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:14.067
Yeah. Wait, Iceland too?

00:02:13.802 --> 00:02:17.579
Oh god, Is it, is it greenland higher than iceland?

00:02:16.897 --> 00:02:19.014
Iceland?

00:02:20.502 --> 00:02:22.678
I thouht you...

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.169
Oh, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:30.505 --> 00:02:33.527
 Oh, cause there's no.. Is it pretty hard to get to?

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:54.170
Oh okay, when you're going to Alaska, it's like, it's pretty much everybody speaks English.

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:59.564
Yeah, but isn't there a lot of indigenous people in Alaska? 

00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:06.484
Oh, okay, so they speak English basically? Okay.

00:03:06.484 --> 00:03:10.938
So that makes it convenient to be able to communicate with everybody.

00:03:10.555 --> 00:03:15.545
yeah, yeah, yeah,  you know when you call 9-1-1 you know, hehehehehe.

00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:37.094
What? No, what? what? 

00:03:37.094 --> 00:03:41.600
actually traveling with you and your sister like you know emergency services is kind of a concern

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.330
because you know keiko's leg or like you running to the glass door you know

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.075
So that's, that's good to know.

00:03:53.497 --> 00:03:58.350
Haha. there you go, yeah, yeah,

00:04:01.965 --> 00:04:05.326
And another good thing about traveling with all of us is like

00:04:05.326 --> 00:04:07.841
You know, even if we book a midnight flight.

00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:12.836
You know, we'll make it this time, you know? Hahahahahahaha.

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:15.451
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:21.426 --> 00:04:25.644
Hmmm...For me, that's, that's  a harder choice for me.

00:04:25.644 --> 00:04:28.305
Really? Yeah, it's not clear-cut for me.

00:04:28.326 --> 00:04:32.816
Yeah, I would struggle with that. I'm like on offense.

00:04:32.816 --> 00:04:37.069
No, I don't know. I don't know. it's that, It's like , as I'm thinking about it right now.

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:42.252
I'm literally on the fence like I can't think one way together.

00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:46.281
okay if it's a northern light trip right to alaska like how long do you think we'll be gone for

00:04:51.615 --> 00:04:53.521
Oh really? That's quick?

00:04:59.478 --> 00:05:03.545
So isn't it better if we're there multiple nights?

00:05:05.451 --> 00:05:09.552
Okay, so it's not like it's starkly different from one night to the next
