00:00:16.664 --> 00:00:22.049
So the parents, I got so frustrated.

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:25.170
So. My last two years before my last year.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.304
I was working at the mexican american streets department

00:00:29.506 --> 00:00:34.628
and but Iwe, there was a big huge...

00:00:34.756 --> 00:00:37.015
National debate wether

00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:41.589
Classes and like Crocs and CNN

00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:44.204
were and I had.

00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:50.350
The Arizona Department of Education in my classroom, like observing us.

00:00:49.198 --> 00:00:54.445
Because they thought we were teaching people to overthrow the government.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.012
I'll be in subordinate,  like it's just ridiculous. So.

00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:05.012
Yes, to make sure that we were not teaching hate.

00:01:05.012 --> 00:01:09.609
And I'm  like,  I have,  I have every color in my classroom. Are you kidding me?

00:01:08.775 --> 00:01:13.780
You know like every in show anyways.

00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:17.517
At the end of that school year, when all of that went down, they let us all go.

00:01:17.517 --> 00:01:21.600
Like giving us these stupid excuses.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.950
Giving us stupid excuses why, why, they let us go. But then.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.677
They probably realized what they did was wrong, so they hired us all back for the next school year.

00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:35.588
So after tw- I went to a different school, and I 

00:01:34.457 --> 00:01:38.779
Because I, littlie you know we got department got this banded, so

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:42.444
We have to go to two different things, but...

00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:45.546
Um. Oh, there was this kid. He was a only child.

00:01:45.546 --> 00:01:50.608
So spoiled and so bratty, he never did his work.

00:01:49.392 --> 00:01:56.243
So. And I was teaching an elective classroom , like, you know what? It's on you. Like

00:01:54.388 --> 00:02:01.307
So, when the, when he ended up getting like a zero or an F.

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.358
Mom got upset.

00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:09.854
Like, why didn't you let me know my son was failing? why you didn't let me know

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:12.888
He didn't turn in the assignments, I'm like

00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:16.347
He's your only child. I have 120 students. Why aren't you more on top of your kid? So.

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.176
She went to the administration.

00:02:19.176 --> 00:02:24.445
And she said, I'm going to go to the school district if you don't change it.

00:02:23.515 --> 00:02:28.841
to pasing  it. And they came to me and they're like, when you change his grade, I said, absolutely.

00:02:28.138 --> 00:02:32.918
Absolutely not. I don't care if I go. I've already been with the district.

00:02:31.682 --> 00:02:35.664
for the past couple years, right? I was like, do not change his grade.

00:02:35.664 --> 00:02:40.872
So they changed it behind my back. So it's like.

00:02:40.658 --> 00:02:45.082
So it's like they gave him and I was like, okay, I'm done.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.544
And then I started to like wanting to do something different in.

00:02:48.944 --> 00:02:55.003
Um, so I left teaching and I let my certificate expire. 

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:58.786
Because I wanted to work with victims or survivors of trafficking.

00:02:58.123 --> 00:03:04.353
And so I left Arizona and moved to L.A. and I was working with survivors of

00:03:02.325 --> 00:03:06.088
you know, sex slave and sex trafficking.

00:03:06.088 --> 00:03:09.093
Um, labor trafficking.

00:03:09.093 --> 00:03:14.150
And that's when my social work started and that was like...

00:03:12.807 --> 00:03:15.998
You know 12 years ago, it's like

00:03:15.337 --> 00:03:20.405
I was in the education for 19 years and I left that and now I've been in

00:03:19.894 --> 00:03:24.032
Social work for the past 12.

00:03:31.486 --> 00:03:33.201
I hope.

00:03:34.182 --> 00:03:38.626
I seriously, it was if  I'm so done.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.986
I am so done.

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:45.475
Yeah.

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:48.025
Exactly. Yeah.

00:03:49.176 --> 00:03:53.563
 You know, just a

00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:55.718
Kid, like, like before?

00:03:55.718 --> 00:04:00.121
And I'm sure like you guys feel the same if you

00:03:58.757 --> 00:04:04.230
Not that you guys would get in trouble, but if you guys got in trouble, like when I got in trouble at school.

00:04:02.908 --> 00:04:05.421
My mom was like, wait till we get home.

00:04:05.421 --> 00:04:09.421
Like, what did you do? So she had the teacher's back.

00:04:08.695 --> 00:04:14.175
Then I get to say my piece and she'll be like, okay I'll listen to you.

00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:16.901
But she never, like, dismissed me.

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:20.382
to what what the teacher said and today

00:04:19.615 --> 00:04:26.252
Parents are like, no, my student's right, my kid is right, you're wrong, and it's like...

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.067
Then you teach them. That's where when COVID happened.

00:04:27.276 --> 00:04:32.225
I was like, yeah, I'll let you guys deal with your kids. See what it's like.

00:04:33.245 --> 00:04:35.334
Hahaha, ***

00:04:52.064 --> 00:04:54.730
Uhuh.. uhum.

00:04:59.487 --> 00:05:02.430
Uhuhm.

00:05:08.362 --> 00:05:12.137
Uhuhm.
