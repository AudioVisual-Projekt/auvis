WEBVTT

00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:17.609
Turn them on.

00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:24.699
Yeah.

00:00:38.776 --> 00:00:41.762
I went once last year.

00:00:42.407 --> 00:00:44.643
I was there for 10 days.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.103
So we went to, we arrived in Tokyo

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:53.048
and we stayed there for four days and then we went to...

00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:56.174
Columbia. So, while we were in Tokyo, I got to meet with

00:00:56.174 --> 00:00:58.688
different missionaries, pastors.

00:00:58.688 --> 00:01:01.573
um... people who used to come to the church.

00:01:01.573 --> 00:01:05.354
And then when I'm in Columbia. I got to uh... stay with the family.

00:01:05.636 --> 00:01:10.631
And um... who goes to the church so then we got to go to the church and they had like

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.158
events um... that were really cool, like with the Elderly and staff. And

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:18.466
um... It was just kind of like a vision trip.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.765
And we went to... I went with like one of the pastors.

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:26.278
So if she's not into like

00:01:26.278 --> 00:01:30.935
anime or anything like that. So, I'm not like, let's put a Akin Karaba, you know?

00:01:30.895 --> 00:01:31.661
Um...

00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:33.612
Yeah...So with...

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:38.953
And and it's weird because as soon as I walked off of the plane and I stepped foot,

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:41.431
I was like I felt like I was summon.

00:01:41.936 --> 00:01:44.116
Yes. And I had always.

00:01:44.116 --> 00:01:47.349
I had always thought I was going to be coz

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:50.798
uh... I've been wanting to be a missionary since 2003.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.363
And... I always thought I was going to be a missionary in Mexico City.

00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:00.129
Because I'm Mexican.

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:04.619
I know Spanish. I know the history, I know the culture, I know the language.

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.774
So, I like big city.

00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:11.504
So I go into Mexico City and I was like, nope.

00:02:11.504 --> 00:02:14.676
This is a cool place to visit but I'm not called here.

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:16.788
And, and I just didn't know.

00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:22.185
Yup, even though it's like those are my people right. So... so

00:02:22.185 --> 00:02:26.725
Um... It was just very weird and it was 20 years.

00:02:26.725 --> 00:02:31.720
So, in 2023 when the lord put Japan on my heart.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.381
So 20 years I was waiting

00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:37.896
to get a place to go.

00:02:37.896 --> 00:02:41.879
And it's Japan. And I don't know why

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.916
this little Mexican girl from Tucson, who knows,

00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:49.407
No Japanese, didn't have really a bunch of Japanese friends, nothing.

00:02:49.367 --> 00:02:52.702
I was called to Japan. So it has to be him.

00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:55.310
And It's not like I'm going to Tokyo.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.618
That's where I would want to go, but it's not about where I want to go. It's like what he's calling me.

00:03:00.658 --> 00:03:01.815
Yeah.

00:03:09.672 --> 00:03:10.617
Uh-huh.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.036
Yes.

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:21.152
Yes.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.405
Yes.

00:03:44.522 --> 00:03:45.409
Yes.

00:03:46.915 --> 00:03:49.412
I I I love them.

00:03:49.412 --> 00:03:52.804
Nicole and Yasko are amazing. I love them.

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:53.795
Um...

00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:56.956
But I did have in Tucson when I was living there.

00:03:56.956 --> 00:04:00.432
I have one, one friend from Japan she's from

00:04:00.854 --> 00:04:05.849
Okayama, and she actually moved to Osaka on Christmas Day.

00:04:06.372 --> 00:04:09.780
Yeah. Yes, last year. Uh-huh.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.658
And um.. so I still keep in touch with her and I got to make a community.

00:04:14.658 --> 00:04:19.248
I really saw how God was building a community within that church and also in me.

00:04:19.248 --> 00:04:21.880
So I'll still keep in touch with some people.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.356
And one day we did photo kawamatsu.

00:04:25.356 --> 00:04:28.899
And randomly I met like two women and they were like just...

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:32.301
And I switched like line with them.

00:04:32.341 --> 00:04:33.885
And so...

00:04:34.047 --> 00:04:39.042
And also like, little by little... Yeah.

00:04:40.008 --> 00:04:40.984
Yes.

00:04:44.812 --> 00:04:46.102
mmm-hmm

00:04:56.536 --> 00:04:59.275
Um... I just take... So I'm

00:04:59.275 --> 00:05:02.522
I signed up with the Japanese Foundation of Los Angeles.

00:05:03.206 --> 00:05:07.088
So um... anytime they have any like cultural events,

00:05:07.088 --> 00:05:10.766
or history stuff, I I go if I can. I teach

00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:13.804
like five classes, language classes.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.488
And um...

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.992
They gave me a good like small foundation, but I just need to build on that.

00:05:21.073 --> 00:05:22.001
And...

00:05:22.492 --> 00:05:23.257
Um...

00:05:24.098 --> 00:05:26.595
about the language. Yes.

00:05:26.595 --> 00:05:30.797
So like, I I know Hiragana, Katakana, and I'm learning Kanji.

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:34.831
I don't know a lot of kanji and I don't know...

00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:37.429
It was very like quick classes.

00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:42.374
And um... So I need to, I need to just like practice.

00:05:42.374 --> 00:05:46.340
I know very little, like probably like a two year old.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.946
But a two-year-old that knows how to read, right? um...

00:05:50.946 --> 00:05:54.237
But I need a practice. And um...

00:05:54.237 --> 00:05:57.511
You know, I watched, like I said a lot, a lot of those videos where

00:05:57.511 --> 00:06:00.665
explains the culture. So when I went there, nobody had to tell me.

00:06:00.665 --> 00:06:03.266
about standing on one side of the escalator.

00:06:03.226 --> 00:06:06.893
Nobody have to tell me to stay quiet on the train because I already knew.

00:06:06.893 --> 00:06:09.660
About like keeping the trash with you or...

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.119
bowing, like different things like that. So, yes...

00:06:14.368 --> 00:06:15.413
Yeah.

00:06:18.384 --> 00:06:21.616
Yes. Just follow what the people are doing.

00:06:22.986 --> 00:06:24.067
Yeah.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:30.668
mmm-hmm
