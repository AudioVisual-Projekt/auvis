WEBVTT

00:00:14.686 --> 00:00:16.786
Yes. Godzilla.

00:00:20.034 --> 00:00:21.676
Godzilla minus one.

00:00:23.063 --> 00:00:25.051
That's the best. Oh, because like...

00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:29.839
but then a minus one like i guess it's one of like the first one i've like fully enjoyed

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.274
Yeah, I mean I think

00:00:32.274 --> 00:00:36.054
I've seen a lot of other ones but like that's kind of like my

00:00:36.054 --> 00:00:39.763
favorite one because of the i get the story

00:00:40.238 --> 00:00:42.547
No, minus one, not negative one.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.607
Yeah, yeah.

00:00:46.152 --> 00:00:49.048
Oh, Shin Godzilla. Shin Godzilla is very powerful.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:50.475
Yeah, but like... 

00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:54.452
Oh yeah. I like Minus One.

00:00:56.195 --> 00:00:58.741
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then when it shoots the beam.

00:00:59.216 --> 00:01:00.202
Yeah.

00:01:04.994 --> 00:01:07.981
Yeah, it's really good. No, it's atomic beam.

00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:10.875
atomic beam that's like the number one

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:15.621
Probably one of the most destructive beams ever Godzilla.

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:18.546
But then like, I actually haven't really seen the other ones.

00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:23.236
but then like the but then yeah so uncle Mao

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:26.679
So, you like Biollante?

00:01:30.017 --> 00:01:33.379
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay.

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:35.930
Okay. Yeah.

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:37.589
But anyway...

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.671
No.

00:01:39.887 --> 00:01:42.993
But then, but then Godzilla still destroyed it.

00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:47.643
It came out in 1980 something.

00:01:47.683 --> 00:01:49.030
about that...

00:01:49.347 --> 00:01:50.817
1980.

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:52.855
1980.

00:01:53.687 --> 00:01:57.129
No, maybe 90, but like around 1980.

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:01.573
No, no.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.310
Biollante only came out once. 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.140
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:06.586 --> 00:02:07.616
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:13.268 --> 00:02:17.740
Yeah, Godzilla versus Biollante. Yeah, it was very good.

00:02:18.862 --> 00:02:19.685
No!

00:02:22.971 --> 00:02:25.590
Oh, uh. I only watch the clips, but then...

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.567
The violante goes like, you know, he'll be going like rarr... but then like...

00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:33.184
I guess. But anyway...

00:02:33.854 --> 00:02:34.726
Oh, okay.

00:02:34.777 --> 00:02:36.758
Uh. Okay. So, back

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.961
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So...

00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:43.527
Mmmm, I've only heard of it. I've only heard of it.

00:02:43.527 --> 00:02:46.147
That's the one where Monster X comes out. 

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:50.843
the Monster X's and... but monster didn't come out though...

00:02:51.595 --> 00:02:54.956
Monster X is like the skeleton monster thing.

00:02:56.184 --> 00:02:57.411
It was quite...

00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:01.584
No! that was

00:03:01.544 --> 00:03:04.858
Mecha. No monster X is like a skull monster.

00:03:04.858 --> 00:03:08.216
I guess I kind of like if you like look it from the front it looks like a

00:03:08.216 --> 00:03:11.219
Skull but then if you look at from the side, it looks like a zebra.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.248
Yeah, it's like white and black and it's a red tear in there but and then

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:18.449
What?

00:03:19.218 --> 00:03:20.133
Oh.

00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:22.823
2004.

00:03:23.648 --> 00:03:24.559
Yeah. 

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:27.275
Yeah.

00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:32.483
So much for final but then like final war it's like

00:03:32.483 --> 00:03:37.478
Final War they didn't have another Godzilla movie like 10 years until they had

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:39.991
Godzilla. No, no, no, until...

00:03:39.991 --> 00:03:45.524
The first Hollywood Godzilla came out. That's where the Muto, Muto came out.

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.712
Yeah, it's like the bat creature.

00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:50.228
You don't remember Muto?

00:03:51.214 --> 00:03:52.244
Yeah. 

00:03:55.426 --> 00:03:59.088
No. That was 1980s... That was Zilla Godzilla.

00:03:59.128 --> 00:04:04.021
You're talking, like you're talking about Zilla Godzilla. Hollywood God- Godzilla the first one was

00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:06.300
the uh... It was...

00:04:11.211 --> 00:04:12.459
Yeah, around there.

00:04:13.724 --> 00:04:18.568
No, that's when the Zilla Godzilla came out. There's a difference between Zilla Godzilla and Hollywood one.

00:04:18.568 --> 00:04:23.563
Maybe it was Hollywood, but like that I'm talking about one of the newer Godzilla the first of them

00:04:23.523 --> 00:04:28.484
That series was the 2014 um, Godzilla. Yeah, that one.

00:04:28.523 --> 00:04:30.482
It was the one where he found Muto's.

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.017
Yeah, yeah. Spider looking.

00:04:34.985 --> 00:04:36.252
You don't remember Muto?

00:04:37.359 --> 00:04:38.191
Muto.

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:42.758
No, it's not a Godzilla, but the Muto's demonstrably fun.

00:04:48.294 --> 00:04:51.407
Oh, I guess. Yeah, but like I'm talking about

00:04:51.565 --> 00:04:54.396
Yeah. That one that one. That's I'm. I'm talking about

00:04:54.435 --> 00:04:58.916
the first line in like the it was that one and then they had

00:04:58.916 --> 00:05:02.780
king of monsters and then they had and then they had

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.092
Godzilla versus Kong. And now they have a New Empire. Wait

00:05:06.092 --> 00:05:11.483
So. What did you... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:13.938
The Monarch?

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.777
Yeah, Monarch. Monarch came out in 2014, I think. And then...

00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:22.186
It, it did a lot of stuff in the 2019?

00:05:22.186 --> 00:05:25.561
And then it didn't really do much and then the Godzilla versus Kong.

00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:27.269
and then it really kind...

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.765
Water. What?

00:05:32.568 --> 00:05:34.543
Yeah, Monaco is still there.

00:05:36.329 --> 00:05:37.816
Yeah, Yeah.

00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:44.426
Yeah, yeah. But then he didn't come out in the newest movies.

00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:51.386
Mask? There's like the people who are like dealing with them

00:05:51.347 --> 00:05:54.705
the monsters and kinda. Remember the guy the, the people were like

00:05:56.308 --> 00:05:59.616
They made, they made the orca. The orca.

00:05:59.616 --> 00:06:02.336
It's because it's a machine that it costs you know 

00:06:02.443 --> 00:06:03.948
No, they didn't. There was a one.

00:06:04.594 --> 00:06:09.012
No, no they did. There's the ones who were dealing with those monsters.
