WEBVTT

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.163
Okay, hm...

00:00:18.532 --> 00:00:20.785
Yeah

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:30.392
usually because like you know weather storm like it... Yeah the weathe- 

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:33.689
From the sun, so there's like three elements. One the

00:00:32.508 --> 00:00:35.983
the sun, the whatever it is emitting.

00:00:35.275 --> 00:00:39.523
that has to be high and then the

00:00:38.987 --> 00:00:43.552
Weather has to be clear on

00:00:42.092 --> 00:00:46.176
Alaska, like it can't be raining or snowing.

00:00:45.832 --> 00:00:49.691
Sounds like it and then the darkness

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:53.608
So those are the three elements that you need.

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:57.110
Yeah.

00:00:58.782 --> 00:01:03.304
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:07.235
Yeah, the weather has to cooperate.

00:01:10.576 --> 00:01:14.890
Yeah, because if the auras are in a higher altitude...

00:01:14.568 --> 00:01:16.617
Yeah

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.372
Yeah, or you go above the clouds.

00:01:26.224 --> 00:01:30.962
So when I went, they... 

00:01:31.468 --> 00:01:34.707
We trekked up into the mountains

00:01:37.323 --> 00:01:40.564
Higher grounds, yeah.

00:01:42.572 --> 00:01:46.638
If you're above the clouds, if it's a cloudy day.

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:54.278
Oh no, I it was part of the, the tour, yeah. And it was fun.

00:01:53.076 --> 00:01:55.108
Yeah, that was fun.

00:01:57.692 --> 00:02:03.266
Yeah. But the flare-up was really low for us.

00:02:02.686 --> 00:02:07.999
The flare up was really low for us, that solar flare.

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:11.236
Yeah, yeah

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.315
That's why I would it's kind of like it's hard to climb.

00:02:13.607 --> 00:02:16.727
Cause you start planning it before you really know.

00:02:16.727 --> 00:02:19.966
Yeah, so that's what makes it hard.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:23.540
But, the p-  one thing I liked about the Alaska place is

00:02:22.617 --> 00:02:25.518
there was a hot hot spring.

00:02:25.518 --> 00:02:30.095
And that, yes, there was a hot spring and so.

00:02:29.214 --> 00:02:33.079
Um. And it was huge outdoor.

00:02:32.607 --> 00:02:34.648
hot springs.

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.765
It seemed larger, it seemed than that.

00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:42.798
you

00:02:44.232 --> 00:02:50.022
It was like, yeah, yeah, but not not a lake because it's not that.

00:02:49.227 --> 00:02:53.356
A pond? Yeah, it seemed like a pond.

00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:57.683
but it's like rocky and it was a weird formation.

00:02:57.683 --> 00:02:58.846
Yeah.

00:03:03.117 --> 00:03:07.382
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then there's rocks and then.

00:03:06.845 --> 00:03:11.452
It was like minus 28 degrees outside.

00:03:11.452 --> 00:03:14.960
and you have to run out there in your bathing suit.

00:03:14.101 --> 00:03:17.780
He's supposed to a young,  to da- mad dash.

00:03:17.773 --> 00:03:23.270
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Heck a lot.

00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:26.425
and then it's freezing but once you get there and you soak in there

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:31.952
for an hour, like you can sit outside the hot water.

00:03:30.621 --> 00:03:33.221
because once your body is really warm

00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:36.898
then you can sit on top of the rocks.

00:03:38.654 --> 00:03:42.807
No, no, it's just right.

00:03:42.807 --> 00:03:46.518
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:51.502
And then, yeah, and so that was really fun.

00:03:50.922 --> 00:03:54.125
And I really spent like time.

00:03:53.438 --> 00:03:58.496
with my friends, because, we,  it's not like, OK, we need to go sightseeing.

00:03:57.831 --> 00:04:04.960
when you do this, this, and this, because there's not a whole mess to do in that wild.

00:04:03.006 --> 00:04:07.190
Um. So we ended up playing card games like.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.435
Just talking and really getting to know one another.

00:04:12.067 --> 00:04:16.387
So, I think that's fun, yeah.

00:04:22.327 --> 00:04:25.877
Ha. Do you think you'll turn ugly with this? 

00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:30.771
But, we I know we've been stuck in that cabin during

00:04:29.611 --> 00:04:33.629
that snowstorm so it's kind of like that.

00:04:32.942 --> 00:04:36.893
but a lot more...

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:42.185
But then there was like dog sledding experience that you can do or s- 

00:04:40.445 --> 00:04:45.702
um was it it like those snow... hiking 

00:04:45.058 --> 00:04:46.712
like you wear those

00:04:47.892 --> 00:04:52.399
Yes... that it is, I don't know.

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:56.954
Oh, something like that, I guess, but it looks like a tennis racket. Yeah.

00:04:56.954 --> 00:05:00.489
Yeah, so a- like you can do that.

00:04:59.952 --> 00:05:03.895
Um. Dog sledding.

00:05:02.928 --> 00:05:06.894
Um. Visit the Ice Museum.

00:05:06.894 --> 00:05:13.194
Things like that. Yeah.

00:05:13.762 --> 00:05:19.399
You know, um, maybe i think.
