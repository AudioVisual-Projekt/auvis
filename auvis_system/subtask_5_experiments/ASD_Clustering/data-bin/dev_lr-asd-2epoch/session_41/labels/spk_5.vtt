00:00:35.632 --> 00:00:37.151
So did you text him?

00:00:51.292 --> 00:00:53.991
I would be really flattered actually.

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:57.536
If someone wanted me that bad, I would be so flattered.

00:00:57.536 --> 00:01:02.091
Exactly! So he probably feels the same way.

00:01:13.517 --> 00:01:17.280
Exactly, so that's like a new file. And you can post your cats.

00:01:19.557 --> 00:01:22.814
Exactly what I'm saying. So are you gonna text him?

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.007
Well, then he wouldn't like respond to at all. But he does respond to you.

00:01:43.588 --> 00:01:48.161
If I didn't like someone and I was interested, I would leave them on read. Or delivered.

00:01:48.161 --> 00:01:50.085
I leave a bunch of people delivered.

00:01:56.852 --> 00:01:59.045
Exactly, he hasn't mocked you.

00:02:02.977 --> 00:02:05.644
It's the truth, like he hasn't blocked you.

00:02:05.644 --> 00:02:08.951

Why would that be beer?

00:02:24.662 --> 00:02:29.066
What if he's like, you know how you're scared? What if he's like even more scared?

00:02:30.585 --> 00:02:34.027
I would be more scared.like

00:02:34.027 --> 00:02:37.976
I feel like making a move is really hard, but once you do it, it's like

00:02:37.976 --> 00:02:40.489
Great like look at all the progress

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.594
All the progress you made by making the first move. Like even just giving that half-eater a loaf of bread.

00:02:45.484 --> 00:02:50.480
would've like, you know? Yes!

00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:56.994
Well, I'm telling you just text him. Like, you're not gonna, like, die or something.

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:20.764
We just asked like what's his favorite song 

00:03:20.737 --> 00:03:24.956
Be like, oh, I've noticed you've been posting lamp a lot. What's your favorite song?

00:03:42.353 --> 00:03:45.088
Wait, it's okay.

00:03:45.088 --> 00:03:49.339
Honestly, it doesn't hurt to give it a shot, right? u know

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:53.929
like you'll never know what you're doing what if he's like super into you and like he's just like

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:57.559
she doesn't have a reason to like text you

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:01.474
and look by him posting that he's like basically like begging

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:05.371
like he is texting u to make a move

00:04:21.892 --> 00:04:25.047
100, like less than 150 followers.

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:30.160
Wait, he's gotta be a loser too. If he's in JBL, he's a loser.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.911
But think about it.

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:42.934
I think so too, but thank you Ash. I don't think you're a loser either.

00:04:46.596 --> 00:04:49.195
No, you don't look like a loser.

00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:53.414
You look like a silly person. Not a loser, just a silly person.

00:04:53.414 --> 00:04:55.878
Like funny person
