WEBVTT

00:00:17.468 --> 00:00:22.244
Yeah, so wait Call of Duty World War 2...Hahahahaha

00:00:25.723 --> 00:00:27.691
Haahaa

00:00:29.107 --> 00:00:31.704
Oh, I didn't -

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:37.363
Ok, so I like the game because it is I like the historical part

00:00:37.363 --> 00:00:39.878
I think it's really cool. And..

00:00:39.878 --> 00:00:42.747
I think (***). But, um...

00:00:43.287 --> 00:00:47.944
The lore itself, I don't really care that much because it's a historical game. There's not-

00:00:47.944 --> 00:00:51.758
to it. Modern Warfare and those games

00:00:51.758 --> 00:00:56.533
I I think it's okay. The lore... I like the characters.

00:00:56.533 --> 00:01:01.529
But there's like some aspects to it that are like clearly very American politics.

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:06.523
To US, And I think, I it is visible here and there

00:01:06.523 --> 00:01:08.294
Especially in sense.

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:13.949
I don't know, I think it's really boring since they always go after like some Arab nation or like Russia

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:18.453
And it's like I get it historically um.

00:01:19.652 --> 00:01:22.133
I can get the Russian part, but...

00:01:29.203 --> 00:01:33.625
May like go to war. Marcoon

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:36.139
A macaron. A Macaroon?!

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:41.134
It's Macarov

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:45.404
Haha... Literally, But then um....

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:47.917
Uhh... It's like the four horsemen 

00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:51.089
Like that, One of them is Russian .Two of them are like some

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:55.967
Arab nation? I forgot. They made up a whole new nation, Uzbekistan.

00:01:55.967 --> 00:01:57.789
And it's like 

00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:59.264
What?

00:02:01.816 --> 00:02:03.271
What?

00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:12.032
Is it?  .Real nation?

00:02:12.032 --> 00:02:17.027
What? it is? There's so many stands guys

00:02:17.027 --> 00:02:18.884
 Wait, what?

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:22.696
Why is he talking like that?

00:02:22.696 --> 00:02:25.920
Ok,My bad, right

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.409
Oh my god, no way! No, my bad guys, my bad. But

00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:38.578
Haahaa

00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:41.647
Yeah, real, real, real.Ok my-

00:02:41.647 --> 00:02:46.136
I I think the main issue with me with a lot of these war games is

00:02:46.136 --> 00:02:50.945
They say that call of duty development it is not political

00:02:51.148 --> 00:02:55.350
But it's it's inherently political, right?

00:02:59.873 --> 00:03:02.944
We very much take a side.

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:08.495
That's just US politics though.

00:03:13.237 --> 00:03:16.225
Yeah.... no,cause-

00:03:18.028 --> 00:03:19.562
Yeah

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:47.950
because the thing is a lot of the characters in the modern warfare games are like war crime after war crime so it's strange

00:03:59.744 --> 00:04:03.205
No,But  the thing is  like, I don't mind, I don't mind when games get political.

00:04:03.205 --> 00:04:08.114
See if it's good commentary, but it's just like saying oh, we're not political

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:11.844
Even though we are technically a war, it's a war game. so 

00:04:11.844 --> 00:04:16.839
It's really (***) in the call. You just need to restate that a little differently.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:21.142
But,There's just a lot of inaccuracies, I don't like.

00:04:21.142 --> 00:04:24.569
I love the characters. The individual characters I think are really cool.

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:27.825
The Favourite ,my favourite, what?.Oh, Farras

00:04:27.825 --> 00:04:30.475
Farrah she's so cool

00:04:30.475 --> 00:04:33.292
She's so cool. Her and

00:04:33.292 --> 00:04:36.246
Keller I don't call him Alex. That's my brother's name

00:04:36.246 --> 00:04:39.958
But Keller, That just -I didn't have a cooler name.

00:04:40.937 --> 00:04:43.796
No, It's like...

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:48.210
yeah and i don't like calling him alex 

00:04:50.913 --> 00:04:52.959
Hahahaaah

00:04:54.268 --> 00:04:59.095
Ok. That's so wrong of you!

00:04:59.095 --> 00:05:01.289
Wait, We're getting off topic.

00:05:01.658 --> 00:05:02.485
No so 

00:05:03.768 --> 00:05:07.278
Farras is so cool, I love her.Bro 

00:05:09.574 --> 00:05:11.667
I haven't finished the game yet.

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.134
Oh it's probably... I haven't gone that far in the campaign. It's either it's either one or two.

00:05:21.134 --> 00:05:25.723
Yeah, No, I've seen clips of it, but I want to spoil myself just yet

00:05:25.723 --> 00:05:30.617
Wait. Because i think  is ,I'm in the campaign where currently

00:05:30.617 --> 00:05:35.612
They're fighting like... They're fighting against... Oh, this is okay. I forgot the plot already.

00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:40.038
Yeah

00:05:43.122 --> 00:05:47.896
I lowkey just care about the characters. Oh my god, I'm sorry for not knowing everything.

00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:51.305
Also, I just started it, so yeah, I don't really know much about it.

00:05:51.305 --> 00:05:54.242
All I know is that London got like terrorized

00:05:56.555 --> 00:05:57.617
Yeah

00:05:59.383 --> 00:06:02.019
No, this isn't world war 2

00:06:03.304 --> 00:06:05.127
But so is the Modern Warfare!

00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:07.358
Yeah

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.463
Oh no,Sorry it's not Uzbekistan, it's Urzekistan.

00:06:14.593 --> 00:06:17.800
No, I just mispronounced it.It's not urzekistan
