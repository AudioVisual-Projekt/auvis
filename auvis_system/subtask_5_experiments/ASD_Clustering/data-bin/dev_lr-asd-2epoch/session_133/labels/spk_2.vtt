WEBVTT

00:00:22.178 --> 00:00:25.587
KKC. hmm hmm yeah

00:00:25.587 --> 00:00:28.929
or We can talk about robotics.

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:34.497
uh hahahahha

00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:42.159
I don't have anything I really want to talk about. 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:45.112
 Okay, so how did the caveat go?

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:47.626
Are you confident? What did you apply for?

00:00:47.626 --> 00:00:51.625
dealing ?How much have you done for club?

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:53.836
Like general meetings.

00:00:55.912 --> 00:00:58.832
okay?

00:00:58.886 --> 00:01:02.514
 some secondary position.

00:01:05.717 --> 00:01:08.366
I don't know, they might've stole your idea. Who knows?

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:13.174
They might just throw you a silver, who knows. You can't just get that.

00:01:13.174 --> 00:01:16.567
no chance hahahah

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:21.157
Are you gonna do robotics? is that it?

00:01:21.157 --> 00:01:24.279
I don't know, maybe when he becomes president.

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:28.650
It could.

00:01:30.135 --> 00:01:32.919
I can still go into committee and just push really hard for it.

00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:40.007
But at the same time, I feel like Sedan is too good at interviews.

00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:43.448
Even if he's a bozo in practice.

00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:56.460
They're good at interviews but they are bad at every competitions 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.285
Because that's just how robotics works with (****)

00:02:05.285 --> 00:02:07.969
Last year, but current people.

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.630
They suck. They got all their judging practices.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.457
That's what they're good at, just lying. But as far as actually doing stuff...

00:02:16.457 --> 00:02:19.476
Well, they don't check if you actually do stuff.

00:02:19.476 --> 00:02:24.472
Like, they aren't gonna check if you actually did something in Libya. All they know is that, what did you say, Eric? 

00:02:24.472 --> 00:02:28.961
He tried to interrogate you but in the end...

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:33.516
It's like college apps. They can't check your logs that much

00:02:38.698 --> 00:02:42.308
I'm supposed to be DOE and I'm supposed to be making it but

00:02:42.308 --> 00:02:46.157
Mon is just kind of pushing ahead of it. Kind of carrying the entire thing.

00:02:46.157 --> 00:02:50.831
cause i...

00:02:51.606 --> 00:02:54.645
He was peeing for a couple of stuff and I just...

00:02:55.117 --> 00:02:57.783
Alt-tab, and alt-tab back.

00:02:58.076 --> 00:02:59.776
(****)

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:08.027
It's supposed to start next Monday, but then it's like...

00:03:08.027 --> 00:03:12.110
They want to keep the electronic stuff on Fridays when I'm busy at the table.

00:03:12.137 --> 00:03:16.491
So it's gonna be really funny.  And I just do not do any of the electronic stuff for them.

00:03:16.463 --> 00:03:20.226
I do all the cat stuff but then I think it might end up just being...

00:03:20.226 --> 00:03:24.598
someone's gonna do like (****)

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.224
Yeah, last year's stuff yeah

00:03:42.738 --> 00:03:45.337
I remember I wanted to check kept checking stuff

00:03:45.337 --> 00:03:50.331
on the discord server because I never could actually go to the meetings of the FEC and I never saw anything posted.

00:03:50.331 --> 00:03:54.669
Like you said, alright guys, we're having something today or hey guys, we're having something today.

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:59.494
Here's the lusher notes. I mean it's fair enough at the same time.

00:03:59.494 --> 00:04:04.490
There's a submissions tab, I feel like there's stuff meant to be done with that, I'm just never pulling through with it.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.928
so i dont know what happened

00:04:15.527 --> 00:04:18.529
You should do performance.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:23.323
but you just go into account and show or id like at any time or even nso

00:04:23.323 --> 00:04:27.338
You should do counter id  NSO

00:04:30.831 --> 00:04:33.329
Fair enough. Maybe if they went out there.

00:04:33.329 --> 00:04:37.768
I think the seat might have one after if we get, because we're probably going to get invited.

00:04:37.768 --> 00:04:42.762
(****) they are looking like something i dont know

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:54.247
huh? okay.

00:05:06.692 --> 00:05:11.518
i was carrying so hard. Like, how come I'm being a bum? Like, even in real life?

00:05:11.518 --> 00:05:15.163
Half the time, I just wait until the latest I can to do it.

00:05:15.568 --> 00:05:19.685
But then like Kai was just like doing everything way ahead of time and actually practicing the dance.

00:05:19.684 --> 00:05:24.680
So I feel really bad for them because they're doing like everything

00:05:29.067 --> 00:05:34.062
I should, but I want to- . I want to go home and game.

00:05:34.062 --> 00:05:38.584
(***) since 9th grade

00:05:38.584 --> 00:05:42.516
I was pulling all nighters in 9th grade for Flora's Outlines.

00:05:42.516 --> 00:05:47.040
and then in 10th grade for stat homework and last year was still math homework.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.191
 Like I always put all nighters because I want to just keep playing games and it's like oh

00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:53.705
2 am Maybe I should start doing homework.

00:05:53.704 --> 00:05:57.030
And that's been my entire lifestyle for the past four years.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.990
Probably earlier too actually. Yeah earlier too actually.

00:06:03.374 --> 00:06:07.610
. I really need to start doing  setting up.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.199
If I say I'll do it in college, that's a bad idea. I won't.

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:16.891
It needs to start now with Taichung and Jabul.

00:06:16.891 --> 00:06:18.696
But at the same time...

00:06:19.136 --> 00:06:23.422
It's one button to open game.
