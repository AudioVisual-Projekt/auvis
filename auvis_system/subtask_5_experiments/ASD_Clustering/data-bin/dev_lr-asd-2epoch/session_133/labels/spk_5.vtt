00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.628
ohhhh

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:56.267
So I noticed with a lot of superhero here  with their costumes 

00:00:56.187 --> 00:00:58.938
When it's like something hot like bottle 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.795
or like ...It looks like plastic. its like..

00:01:03.768 --> 00:01:08.678
You look fake. You look like really bad styrofoam cosplay.

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:18.340
They need to make it really good. and

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.166
Like, they spent like a hundred billion dollars on this movie. It's like...

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:27.673
But it doesn't look like you did. It looks like you spent...hmmhm

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.085
hmm what?

00:01:41.526 --> 00:01:44.091
Oh my gosh!

00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:47.213
thats crazy i think we were like

00:01:47.214 --> 00:01:50.876
 teamwork was ur teamwork You like the Lego movie

00:01:55.584 --> 00:01:58.755
What do you mean you're okay with it?

00:02:03.632 --> 00:02:07.868
It's so funny. I rewatched all the Lego movies.

00:02:07.868 --> 00:02:12.644
movies like Ninjago, Batman, and the original Lego movie outside.

00:02:12.644 --> 00:02:16.745
You guys are so funny. Why did I hate that? I hated all of those movies when I was younger.

00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:21.739
And then I watched it again. These are actually really good movies. They're really funny.

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:21.773
you

00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:32.810
It's a good movie. It's a comedy for real.

00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:41.170
what? jabian?umm

00:02:42.105 --> 00:02:44.906
I don't know, I don't really have a favorite favorite.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.195
honestly i feel like um (****) i just really like them

00:02:49.195 --> 00:02:53.160
no, see how

00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:58.106
I like his blonde hair. He looks like a shyster.

00:02:58.105 --> 00:03:02.848
He looks a lot better with the black hair in my opinion 

00:03:04.838 --> 00:03:08.129
Because when I see him with the blonde hair, it's like, he's gonna scam me.

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.711
He's definitely going to scam me.

00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:13.395
You don't like those snake oil sellers

00:03:13.368 --> 00:03:18.008
thats what he looks like.The black hair he looks more normal

00:03:18.034 --> 00:03:20.550
hahaha

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.160
But he's European. He's actually blonde.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.860
I think it's a really nice movie.

00:03:32.361 --> 00:03:35.939
original book? I know the original book is very different.

00:03:39.895 --> 00:03:42.983
hahhaha really?

00:03:49.675 --> 00:03:52.223
Oh i like it

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.165
No, I was like damn you just accepted the fact that you're an old lady and now you're just working in this house

00:03:57.218 --> 00:03:57.961
I was.

00:03:58.566 --> 00:04:03.476
 Like, Lowkey , the urgency in her...

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:07.647
in her own movie it's like it's kind of not there

00:04:13.638 --> 00:04:18.633
It's all about Howl. I mean, it is his movie, Howl's movie yeahh so

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:21.231
but it's like we started with

00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:24.556
ummm We started with her, so...

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.010
No, it's it's the age gap like see if I did another age

00:04:32.984 --> 00:04:37.911
I could just like oh, she's like 24. He's like 28. That's fine

00:04:37.937 --> 00:04:41.026
but..

00:04:41.026 --> 00:04:44.182
As I almost twice your age

00:04:47.608 --> 00:04:51.961
Actually, no, that wasn't the... Actually, I'm gonna check you on that.

00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:56.653
That's actually over exaggerated. The original technically was like 14 and 30 something.

00:04:56.653 --> 00:04:59.167
But they lowered, they changed it.

00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:04.026
So she was a little older. She was like, what, 17, 16? And the guy is probably...

00:05:04.026 --> 00:05:08.076
They said it was like it was like it was like 19 or 20

00:05:08.076 --> 00:05:12.870
So the gap isn't as, see, it's still bad, but it's not as bad as

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.055
14 and 16 and 30 something.

00:05:17.055 --> 00:05:21.475
It's still really bad

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.444
But you know what? I accepted because back then they were strange anyways. They were freaky.

00:05:26.444 --> 00:05:31.152
They're on something.

00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:35.785
Is there a Disney princess movie? ummm.. I don't see it.

00:05:35.785 --> 00:05:40.781
Objectively like

00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:40.865
you

00:05:42.593 --> 00:05:47.031
Oh, the Maleficent. but

00:05:47.031 --> 00:05:51.925
i lowkey Think CGI for Disney movies has kind of like

00:05:51.951 --> 00:05:55.951
yeah I think Maleficent was like peak

00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:58.971
And then everything else was like...

00:05:58.945 --> 00:06:01.966
They were really good. and I think...

00:06:01.993 --> 00:06:04.507
The Dalmatian one like um

00:06:04.507 --> 00:06:07.612
I think she's okay. She's okay. I think she low-key ate

00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:11.871
 She was really, yeah, she was cute.

00:06:11.898 --> 00:06:14.564
Not the original, not the original

00:06:14.564 --> 00:06:17.601
but the villain when she got her own

00:06:19.374 --> 00:06:23.490
I don't think there's... I don't know. I just think the costumes are really nice.
