WEBVTT

00:00:07.604 --> 00:00:13.584
umm, We need to find something let's to talk about. We're starting to lose it. um...

00:00:13.584 --> 00:00:18.579
ch, I'm....... I don't know, what, to talk about, it's hard to talk about

00:00:19.336 --> 00:00:21.867
I feel like, so give me pen

00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:26.796
I feel like***,

00:00:29.548 --> 00:00:34.542
I don't think I have a preference just quite yet. I think

00:00:34.732 --> 00:00:38.680
Well, for masters, all definitely go out of there

00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:41.005
Like definitely.

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:47.162
and then i'll figure i honestly haven't thought about after and afters righting things so

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.615
 I don't know

00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:51.896
You seem like you don't want to go out, yet

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:03.533
So you would rather go like somewhere else?

00:01:08.426 --> 00:01:09.487
mm mm

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:12.826
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.544
Okay

00:01:33.717 --> 00:01:35.968
That make sense, that make sense

00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:40.356
mmm, um, I 

00:01:44.822 --> 00:01:47.495
Yeah, I feel like I would

00:01:48.252 --> 00:01:52.927
I would though, definitely East Coast.

00:01:54.263 --> 00:01:56.521
We'll tell you how to do better.

00:01:58.171 --> 00:01:59.269
I guess

00:02:00.368 --> 00:02:05.364
If you were to apply for a master's in East Coast, which one would 

00:02:05.364 --> 00:02:06.748
really which you have to find?

00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:14.438
It's it's worth a shot, you should at least try it.

00:02:16.187 --> 00:02:17.134
yeah yeah

00:02:18.535 --> 00:02:21.606

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:29.184
 Here to avenge her.

00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:31.755

00:02:39.355 --> 00:02:40.865
Any C?

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.465
Whereas, would you go Isment?

00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:48.749
No. um... Would you go Indiana?

00:02:50.843 --> 00:02:53.843
Indiana? It's not, it's like

00:02:55.585 --> 00:02:58.266

I don't know if Northwestern has a good master's program.

00:03:10.805 --> 00:03:13.741
ch Northwestern is good. That's all I know. Maybe I'll just...

00:03:13.741 --> 00:03:17.538
It's worth a shot. I think it's worth a shot. Yeah

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.532
Yeah. I guess I'll apply to USC too.

00:03:23.555 --> 00:03:27.140
 but feel like, yeah but I feel like

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.670

00:04:07.808 --> 00:04:12.804
 Yeah, I think that. But like, I feel like

00:04:13.782 --> 00:04:18.777
Master, we can think about right now. what concerto would you want to learn for master's audition?

00:04:18.777 --> 00:04:21.104
It's haven't thought about it.

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:28.464
 I feel like Brian, i don't like it go to like my classes this quarter, cuz it's like

00:04:28.464 --> 00:04:31.299
Brahms Beto or not Beto

00:04:31.299 --> 00:04:35.248

00:04:40.191 --> 00:04:43.448
Yeah, yeah and then

00:04:43.448 --> 00:04:45.274
I don't know. I feel like 

00:04:46.335 --> 00:04:50.198
I don't think they played the same songs for most

00:04:51.486 --> 00:04:55.193
I mean, they'll probably ask for Mozart

00:04:56.633 --> 00:04:59.243
I might you know from high

00:04:59.243 --> 00:05:03.851
 but that's because I'm like regarding *** or like

00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:07.917
But, I guess, That's about it.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.972
Or, I want to

00:05:13.554 --> 00:05:17.147

00:05:29.635 --> 00:05:32.134
French. French is 

00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:35.937
No. I can barely take German

00:05:35.823 --> 00:05:39.464
I don't think I can take French. French is more complicated

00:05:39.388 --> 00:05:41.921
***yeah

00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:46.830

00:05:48.602 --> 00:05:49.784
That is true.

00:05:51.031 --> 00:05:51.940
yeah

00:05:53.335 --> 00:05:55.043
I'll think about it.
