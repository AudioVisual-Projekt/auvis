WEBVTT

00:00:08.723 --> 00:00:10.486
The Northern Lights you know

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.513
hahahaha

00:00:13.732 --> 00:00:15.542
Ahw, okay

00:00:20.546 --> 00:00:25.329
Like, are talk, are you talking.., are you, are you talking about like...

00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:29.751
***from Northern light, are you talking about Panda Express?

00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:34.038
Like, mmm mm

00:00:34.195 --> 00:00:34.977
ohh

00:00:35.032 --> 00:00:39.758
Well, okay, favorite in terms of enjoyability, honestly.

00:00:40.078 --> 00:00:44.720
Honestly, the the chicken tenders and fries are the bomb.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.394
They're really good, but in terms of like

00:00:49.394 --> 00:00:51.789
Really?

00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:59.586
ahw I like that much. I like I do really like the Danette fries though.

00:00:59.586 --> 00:01:04.396
I think I did like the fries more than the luval fries but the luval fries are also really good

00:01:05.256 --> 00:01:06.099
Yeah

00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:11.229
Yeah. But it's not what I eat the most and it's not 

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:16.665
Like, because it's like there's no vegetables so like I don't feel like it tastes good

00:01:16.548 --> 00:01:20.848
but I don't have satisfaction, you know, yeah

00:01:22.553 --> 00:01:24.459
Yeah, I eat that all the time. 

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:31.310
yeah, this is *** yeah, the burrito bowl is good

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.247
I get that. Often too

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.739
I would say the burrito bowl is like...ss

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:45.232
two or three. It's it's competing with the Northern Lights Poké.

00:01:48.995 --> 00:01:54.459
 The pokey? he likes the pokey, he uses three swipes on the pokey

00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:56.572
 I don't know

00:02:01.677 --> 00:02:04.352
Oh definitely, definitely but

00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:06.728
Flavour

00:02:07.373 --> 00:02:11.533
Something like that. It's und it's under two swipes for the small

00:02:11.416 --> 00:02:14.780
and the large is more than two slices. No large is left there

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.780
I think it's it's 17.19 or 15.19 for all

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.080
No, no, like

00:02:20.434 --> 00:02:24.569
Large is 19, small is either 15 or 17. I forgot which one.

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.248
But it's under 9. I mean, under 2 times that

00:02:29.378 --> 00:02:30.272
Yeah.

00:02:32.348 --> 00:02:35.588
Yeah, so it's a it's a, two times, yeah

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:39.334
I get this, I get this, yeah, well I get it cuz I have the swipes

00:02:39.334 --> 00:02:43.874
So I I don't get it often. I'm I'm like, do I feel like spending too much right now?

00:02:43.874 --> 00:02:48.851
And then sometimes I'll get it. Yeah, I have so many, so I'm like... Yeah.

00:02:53.324 --> 00:02:58.319
They are, I also, okay, my regular places that I go to eat...

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.504
I go to Luval and get the burrito bowl or the chicken quesadilla 

00:03:02.504 --> 00:03:05.726
ch I get the chicken tenders and fries from Luvall.

00:03:06.301 --> 00:03:09.456
ch um I don't know. I don't get the pokey often.

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:13.792
but maybe like a couple times or less than a handful in one quarter.

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:16.868
I get some wine, I get

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:22.297
Yes, I get the Yoshinoya Teriyaki Chicken. It's alright.

00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:27.208
Huhu Yeah, I just alright. Yeah.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.220
I.

00:03:29.301 --> 00:03:33.503
Oh, I do like the fried chicken, but sometimes I'm just like I don't want like the fried.

00:03:34.832 --> 00:03:38.989
Yeah, it depends on the day, it depends on the day it's like if i want something fried

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.325
I'd rather just get the chicken tenders, you know, than get like a rice bowl, you know.

00:03:44.302 --> 00:03:46.834
 and then um occasionally

00:03:46.834 --> 00:03:51.830
I get blaze I get it I get blaze like it's about the same amount I get okay

00:03:52.886 --> 00:03:56.403
Yeah and like sometimes I get panda sometimes I get

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.094
Um, I like a veggie grill. Yes.

00:04:01.094 --> 00:04:05.802
and then sometimes okay i actually haven't been to epic ackerman this quarter but i went a lot last quarter

00:04:06.193 --> 00:04:10.003
Yeah. The the rose pasta?. Yeah.

00:04:10.222 --> 00:04:13.653
Or sometimes a salad, depends on the day.  No.

00:04:13.885 --> 00:04:16.281
I'll get like a Caesar salad with like the salmon

00:04:18.154 --> 00:04:20.990
I've had it once. It's huge though.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.993
That's why I I can't get it because I only have like an hour.

00:04:23.993 --> 00:04:28.767
Yeah. I don't want to take it. Well like my classes this quarter, i can't take food in cuz like 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.385
 because I'm lab and then the...

00:04:31.385 --> 00:04:35.282
theater auditorium they don't allow. If I had like a class

00:04:35.282 --> 00:04:40.100
Cuz I cuz I eat before those classes. So if I had a class that I could, then I would take it and just like...

00:04:40.022 --> 00:04:41.235
they leave for later but

00:04:43.768 --> 00:04:47.296
