And my dad's like sick and tired of paying for it.

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.764
I'm gonna try and see if I can get a used one and then I can just...

00:04:06.764 --> 00:04:10.292

00:04:35.098 --> 00:04:40.093
get the user you know what's really like really annoying all that there's so many Xbox PS games

00:04:40.093 --> 00:04:44.261
And they're really good games. But then if you go to PS4, there's like none.

00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:48.175
I know, but there's none for PS5 either.

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.768
And

00:04:54.031 --> 00:04:58.656
I know. And the thing is really though, because they don't do like cross like.

00:04:58.656 --> 00:05:00.190
project.

00:05:08.055 --> 00:05:12.442
