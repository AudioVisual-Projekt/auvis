00:00:35.104 --> 00:00:40.014
So, um , who is your favorite feminist literature?

00:00:40.014 --> 00:00:43.372
I'll start Jane Austen

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:51.381
I've never read any of her book.

00:00:54.544 --> 00:00:57.176
Mmm, yeah yeah

00:01:00.687 --> 00:01:03.471
Dude, He's good. He's actually good.

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:13.529
Mary Poppins? Yeah, what did she write ?

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:16.261
That's not feminist literature!

00:01:17.532 --> 00:01:19.412
Yeah

00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:25.053
That's not feminist.

00:01:25.053 --> 00:01:27.467
But she- But she's not feminist.

00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:36.428
pro-women literature written by women

00:01:46.923 --> 00:01:48.476
Don't worry we can tell.

00:01:53.216 --> 00:01:58.449
Um, Jane Austen .what do you know about um-

00:01:58.449 --> 00:02:02.634

00:02:02.634 --> 00:02:07.089

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:10.565
(***)and they crawled and they fell in love

00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:17.806
No, it's fem- it's for women. No, I'll pull it up after the session. I'll show you.

00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:24.944
Haahaa

00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:29.567
Ummm..

00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:37.346
Uhhh... That's not feminist, she's literally writing about a man.

00:02:37.346 --> 00:02:41.210
Oh yeah. Oh, have you guys read the Odyssey?

00:02:41.632 --> 00:02:45.598
oh. I know! (**) read it.

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:49.750
Oh. Alright then

00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:54.556

00:02:55.343 --> 00:02:57.902
That's you that's you

00:02:59.503 --> 00:03:02.912
Yeah. you sh- you should nod like a active listener

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:06.476
This is not an actual sce- 

00:03:07.924 --> 00:03:12.632
 Yeah, I wanted to do this one.

00:03:12.632 --> 00:03:14.437
(***)

00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:20.142
I did the the the big the  friendly giant.

00:03:21.406 --> 00:03:22.994
I don't remember that one.

00:03:36.002 --> 00:03:38.721
Haahaahaa..

00:03:42.787 --> 00:03:46.958
But aren't like feet inherently rectangular, no?

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:52.862
I don't like that.

00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:10.276
The friendly giant ,yeah .....I don't remember anything

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.145
Oh, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.431
Yes! Yes, yes. Charlie was awesome.

00:04:25.905 --> 00:04:27.025
yea

00:04:26.983 --> 00:04:29.380
Did you have a little crush on Charlie?

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:34.358
I didn't either.

00:04:34.358 --> 00:04:38.577
There are some other

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.541
I have a cousin whose name is James after that book.

00:04:44.432 --> 00:04:47.452
I don't think they read it. Sorry.

00:04:47.452 --> 00:04:50.827
I don't remember much about it.

00:04:50.827 --> 00:04:53.562
It was like James who got stuck in a giant peach, right?

00:04:58.742 --> 00:05:01.240
I didn't like Matilda, she had a PMO.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.235
Oh, I mean, I love Matilda

00:05:06.235 --> 00:05:10.925
Oh yeah.

00:05:17.524 --> 00:05:22.317
Oh yeah. How about your sister?

00:05:22.856 --> 00:05:25.540
Yeah, 

00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:29.810
Haahaahaa..

00:05:33.437 --> 00:05:34.416
Uh oh.

00:05:36.406 --> 00:05:39.344
What if you're guaranteed a save?

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:44.389
And the person that you choose will survive.

00:05:56.505 --> 00:06:01.062
Whatever you say

00:06:12.654 --> 00:06:17.194
 Is that how you feel? 

00:06:20.788 --> 00:06:24.839
If it was a brother, he'd be fine.
