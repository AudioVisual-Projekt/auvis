WEBVTT

00:00:38.447 --> 00:00:40.944
okay

00:00:40.944 --> 00:00:43.880
oh yeah

00:00:45.094 --> 00:00:48.875
Or is it i (***)

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:52.621
really i was like (***) ha ha ha

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.974
yeah yes

00:01:01.362 --> 00:01:03.218
From school.

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:07.403
You're not sleeping enough?

00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:11.248
oh

00:01:14.524 --> 00:01:16.617
Sometimes sleeping too much makes you more tired.

00:01:33.358 --> 00:01:35.662
mmmm

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:46.181
yes ha ha ha ha

00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:50.957
 I feel like I might kind of like 8AM's.

00:01:50.957 --> 00:01:53.522
because

00:01:53.943 --> 00:01:56.443
Kind of. like

00:01:56.443 --> 00:02:00.693
I feel like the struggle is just the first hour of waking up.

00:02:00.693 --> 00:02:05.689
but then like my class ends and then i have like a long time

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.652
in the morning like in the library and no one's there so you feel like you one-upped others

00:02:10.652 --> 00:02:14.296
haahaa like 

00:02:14.296 --> 00:02:18.463
I'm in the library before other people and then you feel really productive in the morning

00:02:18.463 --> 00:02:20.979
yeah they like

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:25.838
The con is I definitely notice myself not as focused in class.

00:02:25.838 --> 00:02:30.832
But I don't know if that's because my classes are just boring and dry or if I'm like tired from my

00:02:30.832 --> 00:02:31.558
tired at 8 AM

00:02:37.044 --> 00:02:37.617
yeah

00:02:43.271 --> 00:02:47.084
I feel like I have pressure from not waking up Shine.

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:50.308
She's a light sleeper.

00:02:50.308 --> 00:02:55.134
she has the bunk above me

00:02:57.617 --> 00:02:59.080
umm

00:03:00.498 --> 00:03:03.856
That's true, but...

00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:08.718
I'm not sure I did. (***) I don't know.

00:03:08.718 --> 00:03:11.807
Well, next year, like in a triple, they're all on the ground anyway.

00:03:11.807 --> 00:03:16.802
yeah there is no bus yeah but

00:03:16.802 --> 00:03:19.502
I heard or we heard that like

00:03:19.502 --> 00:03:23.921
For a 2x6 in Gailey Heights, it's really hard to find like a fully empty room.

00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:28.917
want and like especially this year like individuals go out the same day

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:33.474
yeah so i (***)time so

00:03:33.474 --> 00:03:38.469
we were saying we have to like start to think of different options like can be yeah

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:39.296
yeah

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:48.122
You Could try to get like two by fours separately.

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:52.969
Like Yeah you  do that

00:04:23.288 --> 00:04:24.384
Yes

00:04:28.418 --> 00:04:31.355
2x5 is harder than a 2x4.

00:04:31.355 --> 00:04:35.252
there's only like 14 units of that

00:04:38.206 --> 00:04:42.255
that's true, but I feel like 

00:04:42.255 --> 00:04:47.049
I feel like for a 2x5 the doubles are gonna get filled faster and then the triples are gonna be less.

00:04:47.271 --> 00:04:49.531
Yeah.

00:04:58.122 --> 00:05:00.302
Yeah

00:05:04.463 --> 00:05:04.920
Yeah.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.120
You know Sharon is like such a big studier.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.997
And like you know how much I studied last year. I think she does even more

00:05:17.997 --> 00:05:22.502
more than that dissertation (***)

00:05:24.713 --> 00:05:28.324
She just studies all day. No.

00:05:29.843 --> 00:05:32.341
She never goes out

00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:39.040
like i  heard she is close on

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.280
Celina

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.141
like okay selena emily's )(***)

00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:49.453
who's Serena

00:05:51.073 --> 00:05:53.232
I'm talking about Selena.

00:05:57.114 --> 00:05:59.679
Yeah No, okay like

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:03.492
Sharon told me there's like an app that they're friendly which like

00:06:03.492 --> 00:06:07.086
Puts you blind dates based on your opening on your Google Calendar

00:06:07.086 --> 00:06:11.441
So apparently Selena did that like last week.

00:06:12.925 --> 00:06:17.465
I heard it went well, but Sharon was like, yeah, I'm gonna try it.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.528
For Sharon's like a big calendar person

00:06:22.528 --> 00:06:27.437
Like a GQ person. Like she plans out her day very strictly.

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:34.694
Yes, 

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:38.357
It's like she needs someone that's like a resource.
