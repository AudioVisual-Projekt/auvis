00:00:17.354 --> 00:00:20.813
What is that?

00:00:20.813 --> 00:00:22.837
I don't know who that is.

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:31.900
i dont know..

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.865
I build houses off tutorials. That's about it.

00:00:38.616 --> 00:00:41.215
not really no

00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:43.728
It's not my interest.

00:00:43.728 --> 00:00:47.391
I'm not interested in that because architecture is not my thing.

00:00:52.032 --> 00:00:55.844
I love this shit. I love this shit.

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:05.194
Of course you can. I love Seishun. She's really smart.

00:01:05.194 --> 00:01:09.868
I could tell.

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:15.336
That's not supposed to be an answer, it's just a statement.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.399
I'm glad you could tell.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.169
I don't actually do that, actually.

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:36.396
I don't do that.

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:40.327
I go home and I do my shower.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.664
Why you give me that guy?

00:01:45.154 --> 00:01:49.777
You're so funny. hahahaha

00:01:49.777 --> 00:01:51.667
You are funny.

00:01:56.258 --> 00:01:59.684
What are you on, day two?

00:01:59.684 --> 00:02:02.417
(****)

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.584
Oh, you're on day four still then.

00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:11.090
You're on day 4 still, you haven't said anything nice.

00:02:14.887 --> 00:02:17.503
That's so big.

00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:21.452
You're so fake. You don't actually mean that. That's not genuine.

00:02:28.573 --> 00:02:31.847
okay but you only say this because I asked you to say it

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.370
I will say you're funny because out of the genuineness of my heart

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.917
 Yeah, we want to talk about Minecraft a bit.

00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:51.186
I don't know, you chose the topic.

00:02:51.186 --> 00:02:52.569
Yeah, you did.

00:02:58.676 --> 00:03:01.815
I said sure. I said sure.

00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:07.942
because you suggested it sure implies that like it's okay to be gay

00:03:07.942 --> 00:03:11.942
Like, I wouldn't prefer, but I'm not really against it either.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.339
I know.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.559
Can you stop doing that?

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:36.680
At least my forehead's not over me all the time.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.596
(****)

00:03:41.152 --> 00:03:44.477
That's five. That's five.

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.311
(****)

00:03:55.783 --> 00:04:00.069
Day 5!

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.154
What I enjoy most about Minecraft is...

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.714
I like fishing, I already said that but...

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:11.223
Oh I like reading the animals.

00:04:11.223 --> 00:04:13.823
And then you kill them for food.

00:04:13.823 --> 00:04:16.827
I really like killing the animals and like cooking their meat.

00:04:16.827 --> 00:04:19.914
hhahahaha

00:04:19.914 --> 00:04:23.037
hahahhaa

00:04:31.676 --> 00:04:35.439
 Me too, but like, it's like..

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:39.102
I feel like it's just a vibe because when he opens the gate, it's like...

00:04:39.102 --> 00:04:43.893
It's like necessary for survival. So it's like just a part of the game.

00:04:47.302 --> 00:04:50.813
What if I'm out in the wild and there's like no villages nearby, what am I supposed to do?

00:04:50.813 --> 00:04:55.049
What if I'm like on the moon? What if I'm a nomad? Do I do?

00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:03.451
Really? Can I fact check you on that? Okay.

00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:06.085
I will. Okay.

00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:08.902
Nerd.

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.006
I'm mocking you as part of the insult.

00:05:16.006 --> 00:05:19.263
what?

00:05:19.263 --> 00:05:22.739
 I didn't say anything

00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:33.590
So, what do you enjoy the most?about minecraft

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.689
Were you good at it?

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.845
Are you sure it's not because you're on pocket?

00:05:53.638 --> 00:05:58.414
Like, genuinely, if you played Bedrock, like, Windows 10, like, I think it'd be easier.

00:06:01.806 --> 00:06:04.979
You do that too, and-

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.607
bedrock windows 10..yeah

00:06:11.542 --> 00:06:15.963
like you're like limited(***)
