00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.066
Oh

00:00:25.306 --> 00:00:28.431
ummm

00:01:25.387 --> 00:01:28.509
but he still not coming? 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.393
but still (***) is right like thats (***)

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.299
ha ha ha

00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:02.833
Wait, what did she teach

00:02:06.782 --> 00:02:09.363
Oh, it's just like private. (***)

00:02:17.754 --> 00:02:20.560
oh really

00:02:51.635 --> 00:02:56.546
I've been hearing from Alyssa that he didn't talk to her.

00:02:56.546 --> 00:02:59.060
chamber. Yeah. Like rehearsals too?

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.873
and Like during orchestra, I was classroom master in the last cycle, right?

00:03:02.873 --> 00:03:06.451
So I have to be the one like telling him to move?

00:03:06.451 --> 00:03:09.843
Because I cannot believe that he came just for the concert.

00:03:09.843 --> 00:03:13.455
And then he stopped at Nathan's seat, right?

00:03:13.455 --> 00:03:16.003
So like I had to like 

00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:18.956
And he was like talking back kind of and I

00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:23.361
Believe it.  She's in the Boston.

00:03:23.361 --> 00:03:28.355
I'm supposed to sit here. That's crazy.

00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:29.249
it.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.569
yeah (***)

00:03:57.617 --> 00:03:59.490
Is he not double measuring?

00:04:01.118 --> 00:04:02.595
ohhh

00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:09.294
It's a minor. Oh. Nice.

00:04:09.294 --> 00:04:10.559
That makes sense.

00:04:12.922 --> 00:04:15.420

00:05:01.295 --> 00:05:02.378

00:05:25.737 --> 00:05:27.223
