00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:25.674

00:00:25.674 --> 00:00:29.032
That we're having within our club. 

00:00:29.032 --> 00:00:33.725
um so because you're the former president

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:36.441
I was wondering if you could get your advice.

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:41.436
on how to fix these problems, or if there's any advice you'd like to input or comment on.

00:00:41.436 --> 00:00:45.654

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.344

00:02:26.602 --> 00:02:29.537
I don't know

00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:32.507
I remember Mohana showed it to me on her phone.

00:02:32.507 --> 00:02:35.932
I think it was maybe like a week.

00:02:36.137 --> 00:02:38.848

00:02:47.088 --> 00:02:51.020

um other guy they were like peeping each other

00:04:26.347 --> 00:04:30.953
yeah yeah i agree no and then they're always talking about like oh yeah

00:04:30.953 --> 00:04:36.415
Back when we were in the world, all of that was like 10 plus years ago. right

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.407
Back when we were in worlds, like we as an FTC made it to worlds 

00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:46.039
No, I don't think so.

00:04:49.566 --> 00:04:54.477
And they're always like, yeah, we're so award-winning.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.092
Wait, give me like Ian Hudson like

00:05:06.155 --> 00:05:10.087
Wait, where did he end up going to?

00:05:25.685 --> 00:05:27.355

Dude, look.

00:05:44.933 --> 00:05:48.898
Like I feel like the analogy is

00:05:48.898 --> 00:05:52.527
Sadat is like a dad who left the world.

00:05:52.527 --> 00:05:55.277
the club and he's like cheating with his secondary family

00:05:55.277 --> 00:05:57.792
A.K.A. CSI

00:05:57.792 --> 00:06:00.914
and then huh?

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:10.094
Oh my gosh, how many different families does he have?okay then

00:06:10.094 --> 00:06:12.862
