WEBVTT

00:00:44.897 --> 00:00:49.892
Huhhu, oh, okay ah, let me change my position really quick.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.033
ahm

00:01:04.052 --> 00:01:07.140
I don't know what I do in Barrett's class. I just go.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.087
I don't pay attention to her lectures, right? So I just do other homework I have.

00:01:14.328 --> 00:01:16.826
I don't take anything physical, I do online work.

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:20.015
So she has like a key turn, so I'm gonna flash cards.

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:23.592
Or if I have something like to write, then I would do it.

00:01:23.592 --> 00:01:28.588
But if I don't have anything else, I'll just go shopping. Yeah, I, I go shopping.

00:01:29.536 --> 00:01:31.364
No, it's not lost

00:01:34.223 --> 00:01:38.072
Not AliExpress, but I go to like different like, yeah, Amazon.

00:01:38.072 --> 00:01:41.582
And I go like to different like stores with clothes.

00:01:41.582 --> 00:01:44.230
Different cloth stores and then I like

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.832
Buy without *** and then I bookmark it so that when I get home I could open up an account and then I could order

00:01:52.031 --> 00:01:53.057
Oh yeah

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.834
Cuz I'm too lazy to bring mine and my, my friend is borrowing my other computer.

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.202
which is more compact and smaller so it's easier to carry it.

00:02:07.137 --> 00:02:08.199
Ha?

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:12.514
She's so gonna watch what's so

00:02:12.514 --> 00:02:16.192
But we haven't watched anything yet. Not a single movie.

00:02:16.918 --> 00:02:20.711
She made us watch small videos, right? But the thing, the thing is she said...

00:02:20.596 --> 00:02:25.441
You can't sleep! So she gets really mad at us.

00:02:27.223 --> 00:02:30.182
Hey, guys! Like

00:02:30.182 --> 00:02:32.014
One to two hour movies?

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:34.171
Damn...!

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.682
She like sucked out all the good parts.

00:02:39.682 --> 00:02:43.497
And she can build up bad parts for her like for us.

00:02:46.968 --> 00:02:50.010
Like we haven't even gone to World War 2 just yet.

00:02:54.364 --> 00:02:58.734
With we just finished ah The Great Depression.

00:02:58.734 --> 00:03:02.463
And so we are probably moving on.

00:03:02.388 --> 00:03:03.966
to World War II.

00:03:07.592 --> 00:03:10.126
I mean, I feel like people should know World War II.

00:03:10.126 --> 00:03:14.056
It's not hard. You should remember it from like Flores' class.

00:03:20.352 --> 00:03:25.294
religion oh like in like their earlier periods

00:03:25.817 --> 00:03:30.763
Yeah, there's like the second like great awakening and then there's like a

00:03:30.763 --> 00:03:35.403
bunch of them, like from the Protestants to like everyone else.

00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:46.067
Mm Yeah, probably, but honestly? ah.

00:03:47.638 --> 00:03:53.163
I don't know. And she's not that bad. They're actually like a lot of them, it's just like if you know

00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:57.627
what the history like the period is about then you can just kind of guess

00:04:00.016 --> 00:04:00.936
Yeah.

00:04:01.864 --> 00:04:06.187
Cuz, ah one of the MCQs, it was about the constitution and the amendment.

00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:09.331
And I had them all memorized, and it was really easy.

00:04:10.806 --> 00:04:14.704
Not all the amendments, but the ones important to the period, and like what the...

00:04:14.704 --> 00:04:19.193
challenges were with them and it was really easy for me.

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:29.680
she's my highest grade right now. She's our worst teacher

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:33.841
Hernandez really?

00:04:34.821 --> 00:04:37.335
Okay. I don't like her, but her class isn't bad.

00:04:37.335 --> 00:04:40.305
But I wish that I had Owen's style.

00:04:40.874 --> 00:04:44.130
Cuz, it sounds like O is a little easier on them.

00:04:44.055 --> 00:04:45.889
I also teachers bad girl

00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:56.014
What do you mean you want else to do?

00:05:01.677 --> 00:05:03.040
You want a, why?

00:05:05.803 --> 00:05:09.162
That's evil! That's

00:05:09.162 --> 00:05:13.707
No, she hasn't done that yet because most of that we haven't had like

00:05:13.594 --> 00:05:16.298
An MCQ, like MCQ.

00:05:16.298 --> 00:05:19.909
There have been times where there's like three in a row, but that's about it.

00:05:29.933 --> 00:05:33.849
oh she was like ha I got you

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:42.721
mm mm

00:05:45.442 --> 00:05:49.374
So you know. I hear everybody in lane complaining about it

00:05:49.942 --> 00:05:54.825
Cuz, they have all MCQ, FRQ, and then

00:05:54.711 --> 00:05:56.883
have to do chapter quizzes.

00:05:56.883 --> 00:06:00.578
thing is ah for seminar, we do like

00:06:00.503 --> 00:06:04.755
A book we read it we take maybe like at most five quizzes about it

00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:06.755
And then we just wrote an essay about it.

00:06:08.678 --> 00:06:09.566
And...

00:06:11.902 --> 00:06:13.755
Yeah, we're already doing a whole paper 

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:18.720
Yeah. We have ah so there's like three parts to our game

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.715
So, there's the there's our one part one task one, which is a

00:06:23.715 --> 00:06:26.836
group project where we each write an essay

00:06:26.836 --> 00:06:31.798
with different topics about the same, like different perspectives about the same topic.

00:06:31.798 --> 00:06:33.744
And then we do a group presentation.

00:06:34.312 --> 00:06:38.835
And then ahm after that we do an individual essay with an individual presentation.

00:06:38.835 --> 00:06:43.003
And then after that, we take the actual AP test, which is...

00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:45.249
us reading a bunch of papers.
