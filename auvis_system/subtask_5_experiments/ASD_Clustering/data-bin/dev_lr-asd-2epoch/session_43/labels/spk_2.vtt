WEBVTT

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:47.494
hahuh hahuh

00:00:50.255 --> 00:00:53.359
That's it. ahh

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.534
ahh.... cost

00:01:00.446 --> 00:01:02.945
I like their, then lovak

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:07.518
current means people can get through the storyline faster and get to later regions.

00:01:07.404 --> 00:01:12.180
if they need the character materials from there but it's still like

00:01:12.294 --> 00:01:17.019
It kind of feels like it ruins the quality of the story because you will take less time going through the story.

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:29.151
Yeah. Like it was already about grinding before like once you finish all the story

00:01:29.037 --> 00:01:31.547
but, yeah

00:01:31.547 --> 00:01:35.074
Like the whole reason people would need to get to the late regions that fast is just...

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:37.207
yeah

00:01:44.477 --> 00:01:45.577
yeah

00:01:55.753 --> 00:01:56.663
mm?

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.219
yeah

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.906
Cuz you know how some events will have it where, okay, you need to complete this quest and be at this level.

00:02:28.906 --> 00:02:32.635
Maybe they could just do it like that for the banners. Or maybe they could do it like...

00:02:32.635 --> 00:02:36.534
None of the characters are limited, everyone is just like there's just a giant pool

00:02:36.534 --> 00:02:38.693
And pretty king high schools so

00:02:44.382 --> 00:02:47.620
No, but like you couldn't spend the money anyways, just ended up making him wait.

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:59.230
ahw..

00:02:59.987 --> 00:03:02.262
They've work to sake catch him

00:03:11.364 --> 00:03:13.624
I mean, do you remember the one, like, seven month, the, like...

00:03:13.996 --> 00:03:18.855
Two months touching banner when Meholy was having problems, so they had to move to Hoyoverse.

00:03:20.941 --> 00:03:23.850
I think it was like late 2021 or 2022.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.580
or they have or they were having like legal difficulties

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.005
So they had to just run and catch you for sound. We were trying to get the stuff together.

00:03:35.335 --> 00:03:36.283
Ahh?

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.168
I might have been mistaken. It might have been Ayaka.

00:03:42.532 --> 00:03:45.345
like that one long banner, pick

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:51.053
yeah. Cuz they just had 102 days. Are you use 10 months?

00:03:51.053 --> 00:03:53.753
It was actually, I don't remember being 10 months though.

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.135
I mean, my mom actually lasted like a long time.

00:04:09.362 --> 00:04:14.358
No. There was one where, like, it just straight up blocked it over the little pot. I think it was catchy.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.921
I think it was like COVID related legal difficulties or something. I couldn't even go outside or something. I don't know. I'm not sure.

00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:30.456
You know, either, let's talk about a different video game. How do you feel about StarRail?

00:04:37.851 --> 00:04:39.102
huh?

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:42.623
You just buy mash

00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:48.692
ahw..

00:05:01.707 --> 00:05:02.996
mhm

00:05:13.032 --> 00:05:14.843
I need a spidermash for that.

00:05:15.563 --> 00:05:19.886
No, cuz, my usually I main cooked out, right

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.223
So like, a sad this

00:05:23.731 --> 00:05:26.919
My combos are like alright, so, Xingqiu normal.

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.359
Xingqiu he, Xingqiu skill, ah Xingqiu wears were

00:05:31.359 --> 00:05:35.964
Jump to, who was my other? Diona? Yeah, I have Diona.

00:05:35.964 --> 00:05:40.724
for her shield and then Kaeya to ack to make the freeze last longer

00:05:40.724 --> 00:05:44.943
and switch off from though. I used to superneeded.

00:05:44.943 --> 00:05:47.491
I still need to do N1CD.

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.919
Yeah. I'm singing all the way. Cuz, I tend, I thhink

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.914
Before I quit, I told yova, so I was doing double hydel guitar

00:05:58.914 --> 00:06:03.489
but then I quit so I don't remember that one as well.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.051
Wait, who?

00:06:12.957 --> 00:06:14.019
ahw

00:06:20.893 --> 00:06:21.993
mhm

00:06:28.395 --> 00:06:33.390
No, I'm gonna be honest. Every time I went on Twitter for a while, I would see people, uh...

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.306
like just crying over bullying ChiChi and I never pulled her.

00:06:37.306 --> 00:06:40.540
I still, I never pulled her like***
