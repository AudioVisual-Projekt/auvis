WEBVTT

00:00:16.357 --> 00:00:19.985
You know, okay, so her...

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:23.850
Your brother is a CS person from Stanford.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.356
and (***) program (***) like

00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:31.392
goes into master right away. some like

00:00:31.392 --> 00:00:35.223
you know how they combine it sometimes so then he ended up also doing his mask

00:00:35.223 --> 00:00:39.223
masters there and he was a TA for his current girlfriend

00:00:39.223 --> 00:00:43.914
and now  they met him as a TA and her as a student.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.880
Well, we share about it.

00:00:51.255 --> 00:00:54.023
No, I'm sure

00:00:54.023 --> 00:00:56.925
I don't think it was that big. I think it was more like...

00:00:56.925 --> 00:01:01.194
22 and like 19 or whatever 

00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:07.454
i mean I don't know but like

00:01:07.454 --> 00:01:11.724
So they started dating and he got her an internship and that internship

00:01:11.724 --> 00:01:15.082
Or like you know the connections like you need connections

00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:20.078
and then that led to her getting an internship which became her actual job now

00:01:20.078 --> 00:01:23.992
So I feel like and now they're still together so like

00:01:23.992 --> 00:01:27.383
I feel like Sharon's kind of like made that her like

00:01:27.383 --> 00:01:31.400
(***) I was like

00:01:31.772 --> 00:01:35.737
she wants a boyfriend that can like get her an internship and like

00:01:35.737 --> 00:01:38.403
Help her with her school stuff.

00:01:38.403 --> 00:01:42.588
which I don't think is the proper way to look into it.

00:01:42.588 --> 00:01:46.685
Yeah she just want 

00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:51.111
she just want (***) you know

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:54.603
Like yesterday she was called me

00:01:54.846 --> 00:01:59.104
I wish I could get into a relationship without any effort from my side.

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.323
like it's just like I mean it's real but like it's not reasonable

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:04.728
Okay.

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.588
yeah like she wishes her ideal situation just like came up

00:02:09.588 --> 00:02:12.576
yeah

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:18.650
I feel like she's kind of realistically saying that.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.343
Yeah.

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.948
yeah Like I mean

00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:30.648
with a freshman from Bermuda Tuesday.

00:02:30.648 --> 00:02:35.053
Because he wanted to know more about the international internships that she did last year.

00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:37.821
So they had dinner, and he's her type.

00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:40.892
first she's like a busy con major that raves.

00:02:40.892 --> 00:02:45.887
like (***) whatever i show like I just don't find that as fascinating as like...

00:02:46.086 --> 00:02:49.296
(***)

00:02:49.296 --> 00:02:52.822
(***) By like the way he carries it's just like

00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:57.767
That part of her life  lifestyle just doesn't match her.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.998
Yeah. But I told her like...

00:03:06.998 --> 00:03:09.512
yeah you don't have to like think

00:03:09.512 --> 00:03:13.156
oh I'm gonna become his girlfriend and it's not gonna work.

00:03:13.156 --> 00:03:18.152
like you could just like keep talking to him at media team and like get to know him 

00:03:18.152 --> 00:03:22.607
Yeah, I think so she said the dinner was nice

00:03:22.607 --> 00:03:25.391
 she's been talking about it since like last week

00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:30.166
Like it was like yeah, I think I was like I just

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:32.883
Like to go for like coffee or something

00:03:32.883 --> 00:03:37.879
i was like no just like say dinner or like just a chat

00:03:38.756 --> 00:03:43.684
It was just a chat to talk about like the internship stuff but like they've never talked

00:03:43.684 --> 00:03:47.683
We talked 101 before so it's also to get to know each other more.

00:03:49.506 --> 00:03:52.441
Yeah, but like

00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:55.868
Going into it appearance wise, he was her type.

00:03:55.868 --> 00:04:00.643
and then like talking to him she like enjoyed the talk but it's just like lifestyle

00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:07.983
Yeah Yeah, that was like the first time getting to know each other.

00:04:11.678 --> 00:04:14.177
Yeah,Yeah.

00:04:19.172 --> 00:04:24.015

00:04:24.015 --> 00:04:28.081
She likes white people.

00:04:29.078 --> 00:04:31.896
She's not attracted to Asian youth.

00:04:34.223 --> 00:04:37.768

00:04:55.335 --> 00:04:56.078

00:05:00.076 --> 00:05:04.480
