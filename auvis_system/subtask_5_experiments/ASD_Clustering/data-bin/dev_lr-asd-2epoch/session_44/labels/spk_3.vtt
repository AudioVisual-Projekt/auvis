WEBVTT

00:00:33.984 --> 00:00:37.839
So where were we? Good question. 

00:00:40.211 --> 00:00:41.803
ahhh...

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.882
How many characters do you have seizures?

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:54.100
Oh, yeah, no, I am too. I haven't willed on a single game. I'm broke.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.343
I knew he was trying to get me to pay for the skin.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.550
Do you pay for skins?

00:01:07.312 --> 00:01:10.165
Have this three amber and bonus skill

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:18.956
I'm so hap happy that I somehow have staph coma and C1 hooked out.

00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:24.019
The first five star muffin.

00:01:26.377 --> 00:01:27.419
ahw

00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:29.353
Oh yeah.

00:01:30.897 --> 00:01:34.036
Do you ever roll on the weapon banners?

00:01:38.447 --> 00:01:40.741
Wait for who's weapon?

00:01:41.164 --> 00:01:43.593
Oh the Jade Sphere 

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:01.583
What the hell?

00:02:05.513 --> 00:02:06.670
ah

00:02:07.974 --> 00:02:09.024
I .....

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:14.931
***I'm just gotta pulls you to

00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:18.845
Oh yeah, you guys have been like really good at like all of those genres. 

00:02:18.845 --> 00:02:23.672
I'm just glad I pulled ah C1 Putao and Staff of Home across different banners.

00:02:26.013 --> 00:02:28.852
But C1 is just that you can cancel this the...

00:02:28.852 --> 00:02:32.987
The charge attack so you don't need to wait for the full animation

00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:36.413
So then it's like faster cycling and you can get more taxed out.

00:02:36.413 --> 00:02:39.754
You do not understand, do you understand what I'm saying?.

00:02:39.754 --> 00:02:41.270
Okay.

00:02:43.853 --> 00:02:45.010
yeah

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:49.187
Huh? No, it's there, it's stand, there's no like

00:02:49.187 --> 00:02:54.165
and where you're waiting for the animation to finish. Look it just, you can, or no.

00:02:54.165 --> 00:02:58.400
Instead of having to sprint to cancel, you can just jump to cancel.

00:03:01.523 --> 00:03:05.876
Like sprinting uses up stamina, so the, so the stamina goes up twice as fast

00:03:06.737 --> 00:03:07.919
So...

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.610
So instead he can just jump, and it's basically zero sound, no?

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:23.459
Wait, from mom? From Mondstadt?

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:27.342
As far as my style?

00:03:29.147 --> 00:03:30.923
ahhh

00:03:33.164 --> 00:03:35.947
I'm drawing blanks on half the characters because I didn't...like

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:40.943
Kai's ice bridge is funny. I don't

00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:45.229
Okay... okay...

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.671
Okay, but which one can you but which one were people using for like

00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:52.064
Six hours straight to get tickets to Zuma before they had to ship.

00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:58.392
Huh huh, Storms head. No, they're like basically a dentist's offices. No, 

00:04:04.433 --> 00:04:09.427
Huh. They are and then they aren't getting through, it was sweet 

00:04:13.112 --> 00:04:16.649
They could have just cut them off like thorm like 10 minutes in the way would

00:04:17.113 --> 00:04:19.459
Our own ***

00:04:23.957 --> 00:04:28.951
Yeah, Like you can't just like, you can't just like set up a macro file there, because sometimes it'll just get shifted around.

00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:31.973
Oh, thank the Lord. It's like

00:04:33.425 --> 00:04:34.467
um

00:04:35.432 --> 00:04:37.423
Wait, who's your favorite character from each region?

00:04:49.032 --> 00:04:50.576
Ahh?

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.623
Wait, who? Ohh..

00:05:15.712 --> 00:05:17.637
New space.

00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:32.789
Oh wait they made a new costume for him?

00:05:38.868 --> 00:05:39.928
No

00:05:55.858 --> 00:06:00.027
Oh well. So like literally changes everything it's not just aesthetic

00:06:03.772 --> 00:06:07.907
While they get rolling out to like all the old five stars. It was just beautiful.

00:06:10.202 --> 00:06:13.880
Wait, who? Business deal, Okay.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.411
Jean, Mona.

00:06:17.664 --> 00:06:19.130
