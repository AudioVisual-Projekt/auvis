WEBVTT

00:00:37.222 --> 00:00:38.920
What's that big sigh for? 

00:00:41.038 --> 00:00:43.130
You should talk about, what?

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:49.122
What came up as your science for? Like muh

00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:52.196
Unipop popcorn in the microwave?

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.028
dream..

00:01:00.496 --> 00:01:02.347
Why is it such a skillet?

00:01:04.157 --> 00:01:06.787
I can make pancakes. I can make pancake mix.

00:01:06.672 --> 00:01:10.688
He's my second period and I don't I don't do anything in his class

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.017
Yeah, I don't pay attention.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.178
yeah

00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:22.264
Ah well, I'll ask him tomorrow.

00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:25.908
Yeah, and then, right

00:01:27.984 --> 00:01:29.992
It may be***

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:38.987
I wouldn't snitch. No one will snitch in my my class.

00:01:45.213 --> 00:01:47.817
Guys are, guys are just added in class

00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:52.757
Oh, no, because like in my my physics class, we play poker.

00:01:52.757 --> 00:01:56.588
He has Pocahontas. Yeah, he has that the whole set.

00:01:56.588 --> 00:02:00.790
And he gives a poker poker chest when he notices we're playing.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.894
Is it the best at poker? Um, it depends.

00:02:11.894 --> 00:02:15.639
I just bet whenever I can. But initially it's ***

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.520
Huh? Yeah. It's okay

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.968
What do you mean crash ahw

00:02:33.393 --> 00:02:35.839
I don't ditch class, I just don't pay attention

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.585
And I did decent on this test, so it's not a big deal.

00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:45.221
No, It is all, See if I had like a market

00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:49.053
I would do anything else. But it's sad. So, I don't think.

00:02:49.053 --> 00:02:51.532
I don't think there's a pair of you that's crazy physics.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.193
Oh yeah, maybe I shouldn't do I shouldn't do AP Physics.

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:08.525
Yeah, okay.

00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:15.462
But, but I don't think I'm gonna die I don't want to kill myself like

00:03:16.656 --> 00:03:17.504
Uhm?

00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:21.081
PC no? cuz

00:03:21.081 --> 00:03:25.182
The thing is um, I'm going to do, I'm going to do AB, right?

00:03:25.182 --> 00:03:26.583
and then

00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:30.970
If I really want to, I can just go further in college if I want to do math.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.872
Right?, so AB

00:03:33.757 --> 00:03:37.855
And then I'm gonna do J4 because I have AP resource

00:03:37.855 --> 00:03:42.354
Right? And then I have, what's my other AP's? um..

00:03:43.998 --> 00:03:48.588
AP pair, so that's what we use AP. Why do you want to do more?

00:03:48.588 --> 00:03:51.811
If I do Japanese I'll have 4AP's

00:03:53.583 --> 00:03:53.615
you

00:03:58.332 --> 00:04:00.027
mmm....

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:05.661
Yeah, no, I'm good.

00:04:09.984 --> 00:04:13.278
It's a little bit more than that. We actually have to do a whole study by ourselves.

00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:15.672
Like, yeah..

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:20.143
It's a study. We do our own study. We have a thesis.

00:04:20.143 --> 00:04:24.227
And then we go out, figure out what our result is.

00:04:24.227 --> 00:04:29.222
and then we write a paper about it. It is actually a research class.

00:04:31.611 --> 00:04:32.974
Research?

00:04:33.744 --> 00:04:37.576
No, it's not. It's it's probably harder than seminar.

00:04:37.576 --> 00:04:41.170
Because for seminar, all you have to do is look at other people's research.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.692
and then write like an analysis of it um and then come to like a conclusion.

00:04:45.692 --> 00:04:48.628
But for research, you actually had to do research like,

00:04:48.628 --> 00:04:51.447
You're the one conducting a research experiment.

00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:56.245
huh?

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:03.445
You have luck sure, it's like they got a teacher they have to do, like staff.

00:05:07.753 --> 00:05:08.985
huh?

00:05:10.938 --> 00:05:14.944
I want to do research next year. I don't know.

00:05:17.163 --> 00:05:20.995
Because um, it's probably similar to similar to seminar.

00:05:20.995 --> 00:05:24.116
but just more in depth. Just

00:05:24.116 --> 00:05:27.846
Who wants to look down haha and look at your credit card?

00:05:29.001 --> 00:05:32.402
Okay. so, huh huh

00:05:32.402 --> 00:05:34.916
Huh huh huh huh

00:05:34.916 --> 00:05:38.832
So research I think is probably harder than seminar, and

00:05:38.832 --> 00:05:43.455
Yeah. May be why? We're doing a whole research experiment!

00:05:46.602 --> 00:05:50.272
There is an exam! There's probably an exam!

00:05:51.286 --> 00:05:54.796
I don't know. It's an AP class. This is most likely an AP test.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.671
Oh true. No, oh, So for any research, they're probably going to make us do

00:06:03.671 --> 00:06:09.167
A a presentation, a report, and then we're going to answer a bunch of their questions.

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:15.551
No, I'm not going to do come science

00:06:19.978 --> 00:06:24.377
Not big questions. They'll probably ask an specific questions.

00:06:24.377 --> 00:06:29.373
Like, it's a live questionnaire. It's like, they were they were recording you. It's a same-paper seminar.

00:06:29.373 --> 00:06:34.753
Um where after our presentation we start and they ask us questions and it's like
