WEBVTT

00:00:05.147 --> 00:00:06.361
Robotics, right?

00:00:11.323 --> 00:00:16.114
We were talking in Hudson I guess

00:00:23.017 --> 00:00:25.514
Yes.

00:00:25.514 --> 00:00:28.112
Ashida probably knows about this and was trying to beat him.

00:00:28.112 --> 00:00:30.948
Even though last year we physically won. Alright, guys.

00:00:30.948 --> 00:00:35.942
So this year, let's make it a training year for all the new members that are coming in and the new leadership.

00:00:35.942 --> 00:00:40.481
and they said okay no but what if you went really hard and try to make it a world again

00:00:42.777 --> 00:00:47.012
I'm making a second team too, and that didn't...

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:49.527
They should've just tried to relax.

00:00:49.527 --> 00:00:54.335
just get a hang of things but they tried to get immediately start doing stuff and then just

00:00:54.335 --> 00:00:56.850
Did not work out. But last year we won RAs.

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.149
So it was a really bad idea when we tried to do every system simultaneously.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.850
So let's do separate, let's do important subsequence first.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.951
And they still say, alright guys, so love Kumar, go do a set. And it's like...

00:01:08.951 --> 00:01:11.463
Okay, yeah.

00:01:11.463 --> 00:01:14.942
Like I got the feeling when I saw kickoff that oh, there's lifting

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:19.446
Guess who's doing that again for the third year straight?

00:01:19.785 --> 00:01:24.341
during kickoff when we saw the game reveal and I saw that there was a lifting thing.

00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:29.335
I was like, alright, I can guess who they're gonna make do lifting for the third year straight.

00:01:30.926 --> 00:01:32.506
Ah!

00:01:34.246 --> 00:01:37.520
Yes, me. Third year straight doing lifting.

00:01:41.537 --> 00:01:44.859
Okay. Guess why? Cause it's like I'm more experienced at the same time. Like.

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:48.675
Bro, we were saying that we would focus on the important stuff first.

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:53.552
Our intake wasn't even working by the time regionals came around, by the time we went to...

00:01:53.552 --> 00:01:58.309
Champs. Because...I don't know what the hell would even happen to fall out

00:01:59.654 --> 00:02:01.914
Haa!

00:02:03.794 --> 00:02:05.853
We went to regionals last year too.

00:02:10.442 --> 00:02:15.286
But it's still the same stage. Still the same number of teams.

00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:20.078
It's like slightly more impressive because there's more FGC teams every year.

00:02:20.078 --> 00:02:24.533
At the same time, Beast Box is gone from our league, so it doesn't really matter.

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.656
No, Jeffrey's first year as president or as a captain.

00:02:42.656 --> 00:02:45.441
We only got to IOTs I think.

00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:48.733
Yeah, we only got top. We only got to the qualifiers.

00:02:49.694 --> 00:02:52.983
And then we got out there because there was no wild card in it, yeah.

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:58.352
Like, it is impressive, definitely, but at the same time...

00:02:58.352 --> 00:03:01.877
The team is falling..so...falling apart so much.

00:03:01.877 --> 00:03:05.102
It's more just like that we lied really well during judging.

00:03:05.102 --> 00:03:08.965
And then Diya carrying ahhh...portfolios.

00:03:11.985 --> 00:03:13.960
Ahhh!

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.810
And then half of the time when we progress, it's just all been off stage.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.423
Think, just a, it's literally just an engineering portfolio award.

00:03:24.423 --> 00:03:27.933
I'll tease, we only got the wild card because we got first team.

00:03:27.933 --> 00:03:31.965
We've had the best engineering portfolio from wildcard

00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:35.408
It was inspired that we got somehow, even though we're all depressed.

00:03:35.634 --> 00:03:40.106
I don't know how we got that because there are teams that are way more impressive.

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:45.144
In every aspect, but I don't know, I guess they just liked us.

00:03:46.055 --> 00:03:50.882
And then ...ahhh...and then again Irene was like second stage

00:03:55.338 --> 00:03:56.194
Yes

00:03:56.974 --> 00:04:01.159
That's why they didn't want to give us Inspire. They didn't want to give us Inspire.

00:04:04.146 --> 00:04:08.703
Cause if they gave this fight to the 49th out of 49th or whatever team...

00:04:13.495 --> 00:04:14.762
Yes, per intake broke.

00:04:15.412 --> 00:04:21.189
And they spent like two weeks trying to fix that. Well, not they. Dia spent two weeks trying to fix it.

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:26.067
I don't know what everyone else was trying to do...but like

00:04:31.163 --> 00:04:34.790
I don't know if it's still gonna be alive next year.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.288
Or not next, in two years.

00:04:43.264 --> 00:04:46.182
I keep forgetting you're in the same grade as them.

00:04:55.278 --> 00:04:58.012
No, I just don't think of your dream.

00:05:01.454 --> 00:05:05.975
(***) they give completely falling apart vibes and you gives

00:05:05.954 --> 00:05:09.228
Less falling apart. Yeah.

00:05:40.064 --> 00:05:43.456
It's fine if some people are good at academics, but like

00:05:43.456 --> 00:05:47.608
Some people just straight up do not have the brainpower to do more than that.

00:05:47.978 --> 00:05:52.298
And then they try and do more than that and they screw everything up.

00:05:54.694 --> 00:05:58.526
Also there's a small chance of just getting carried.

00:05:58.526 --> 00:06:03.098
What are the kinds of shichis getting carried around? Is it all individual stuff that she cooks on?

00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:05.764
No.
