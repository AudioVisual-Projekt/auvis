Nah, Genshin impact, hahah

00:00:24.865 --> 00:00:27.732
Oh, it is.

00:00:48.355 --> 00:00:53.512
I really want to play Final Fantasy, but I don't want to pay money. Like the only...

00:00:55.914 --> 00:00:56.947
Ooo

00:00:59.913 --> 00:01:03.002

00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:06.883

00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:10.292

00:01:10.292 --> 00:01:14.155
six months and got like to the end stage and just like dropped it

00:01:17.228 --> 00:01:20.197
I might try that. 

00:01:20.197 --> 00:01:23.116
Arianna, have you played any rpgs?

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:27.922
Roblox RPGs are included. Like Vixeria, you played that?

00:01:45.357 --> 00:01:46.971
Cuz it's fun!

00:01:49.636 --> 00:01:50.669
And...

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.331
So does mine. That's why I just dug into a bucket of ice.

00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.333
Hahaha

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.193
Because we don't let

00:02:12.214 --> 00:02:16.123
We don't let ourselves get limited by heat.

00:02:20.087 --> 00:02:24.440
you limit your options just because oh it takes too long to load

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.318
You will never play anything fun that way. Oh, 30 minutes. Oh, okay. Fair enough.

00:02:37.987 --> 00:02:40.052
Ohh, Hahaha

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:53.516
Ever contact support and ask them for a refund?

00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:58.696
No, but you can still contact them for a refund. Cause they're still eating your jams.

00:03:01.258 --> 00:03:03.164
Just contact them after like a month.

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:09.075
yes

00:03:09.075 --> 00:03:11.892
Okay, then wait one year for 12,000 yen.

00:03:26.777 --> 00:03:31.468
Did you try reinstalling?

00:03:31.518 --> 00:03:33.880
When did you try to reinstall it?

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.615
Yeah, Boostaxs

00:03:45.373 --> 00:03:49.963
I got bootstax on my la- on my computer to run shi- to run computer runs.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.570
Hahah

00:03:58.147 --> 00:04:01.994
it is really bad but like sometimes just for dailies

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.860
Does that work for 51?

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.508
If you use it for something that actually needs controls, then it's bad.

00:04:12.508 --> 00:04:15.832
But I only ever use it for a cookie run where I just need to drag it around.

00:04:18.853 --> 00:04:23.814
Wait, if you couldn't get Bluestacks for Genshin, why don't you just download the actual Genshin?

00:04:23.814 --> 00:04:26.970
If you gotta boost extra against him, why don't you just get the extra against him?

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.000
Huhh..

00:04:32.843 --> 00:04:34.783
Why wouldn't you?

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.405
I had- I got Genshin Starril and Zenless on my PC.

00:04:43.405 --> 00:04:44.992
Okay.

00:04:59.927 --> 00:05:02.913
Wait, so... Oh yeah, no.

00:05:05.326 --> 00:05:07.992
Oh, yeah, no, that happens on my laptop, too. That's when I play on my PC.

00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:29.307
No

00:05:37.724 --> 00:05:40.306
Oh wait, no, I have that.I just

00:05:43.695 --> 00:05:46.894

00:05:46.771 --> 00:05:51.631
I told my dad, alright, $2000 PC, very necessary for online school.

00:05:56.795 --> 00:05:58.720
Well, it just sounds like me

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:12.579
