WEBVTT

00:00:10.738 --> 00:00:14.501
At though, oh yeah, yeah, anyways

00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:17.016
Yes, the red shoes like

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:21.876
Like the iPhone recording red. Like that's only. And he always wears the same thing.

00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:25.908
And apparent like yeah, he's a pretty iconic figure.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.221
Like knows like all the musicians

00:00:28.221 --> 00:00:33.216
***You choose them, but apparently

00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:36.979
So he studied with Midori at USC, I think.

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:41.687
And then he later became a guru right hand.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.352
Yeah. Apparently.

00:00:44.352 --> 00:00:49.348
Cuz like, I think me told he has kids studing, I don't know but like

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:53.584
Apparently, like according to my brother, Moni flies to Philly.

00:00:53.584 --> 00:00:59.069
Every now and then, still like, how I told the work like subscriptions now

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:01.978
 like Midori pays her him to like come over

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:05.480
It's like so it's like a mother-son

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.379
Relationship I want in life, like

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.923
Yeah. I don't think I've seen her lie.

00:01:14.744 --> 00:01:18.407
But, maybe I should wear it once or twice.

00:01:19.453 --> 00:01:23.844
Yeah. But I I I refer to the park

00:01:23.807 --> 00:01:25.223
According, Sorry

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:31.164
she has really good vlog recordings and

00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:35.399
I think she like released it over COVID.

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.455
It's like all six sonatas and partitas.

00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:40.173
yeah

00:01:40.648 --> 00:01:43.335
She's, I think she's my height.

00:01:44.323 --> 00:01:46.351
If not she might be a little shorter

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.435
But I think we're like the same kind. Like me....I know.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.768
Me, Midori. And like Midori and Hillary are similar height too.

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:06.331
Okay, Hillary might not be that short, but I know she's short.

00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:10.415
Yeah. I know Hilari is short..

00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:13.626
Midori, I think that's someone the same height as me

00:02:15.526 --> 00:02:18.128
I think Hillary is like a couple inches taller.

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:21.317
yeah

00:02:23.802 --> 00:02:28.066
but, I don't know. it's like

00:02:28.674 --> 00:02:32.201
 crazy how much they produce sound.

00:02:32.201 --> 00:02:34.222
Even though you're so tiny.

00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:39.356
Yeah, yeah like

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:42.089
like everything is so heavy

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:44.941
Like well-pronounced.

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.604
Very very respective

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:52.907
Respect. The Respect goes hard.

00:03:02.378 --> 00:03:03.614
yeah

00:03:03.993 --> 00:03:07.659
uh-huh, yeah

00:03:09.482 --> 00:03:10.705
I know. 

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:16.937
like i don't know if that's like i don't know if that's good and all, like I

00:03:16.937 --> 00:03:21.881
Like I genuinely feel like like

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:25.340
Not like drilling my technique was a good thing

00:03:25.264 --> 00:03:28.581
no like doing it now is a good thing but also at the same time I

00:03:28.581 --> 00:03:30.747
would rather into a wrap

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.562
yeah

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.059
I don't know I feel like

00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:41.083
Yeah. I don't know

00:03:42.578 --> 00:03:43.642
yeah

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.975
Yeah, last quarter was like this too.

00:03:48.988 --> 00:03:50.295
I feel like 

00:03:50.636 --> 00:03:53.808
I mean, I mean, last year. Last year, not last year.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:58.415
It's like kind of when you realize this,  yeah it's like

00:03:58.415 --> 00:04:03.376
It's like when you realize what you didn't didn't do over a cold winter.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.899
But like

00:04:09.267 --> 00:04:11.409
 I feel like, yes.

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.122
Or I don't know about how you feel. Yeah, yeah, yeah

00:04:15.122 --> 00:04:16.759
What? How do you feel?

00:04:27.097 --> 00:04:29.073
mmm..... okay

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.507
So like, even if

00:04:35.507 --> 00:04:39.642
You try to go faster, you feel like it would take about the same time?

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.796
I see I see I, wait yesterday

00:04:46.796 --> 00:04:51.065
I did the double stop staff

00:04:51.065 --> 00:04:56.318
The animal carnival and I also did some session because carnivous like you need to go

00:04:56.204 --> 00:04:58.827
back to that. So I did it before Phil, right?

00:04:58.827 --> 00:05:02.000
and but like before I practice.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.847
Before like before my practice session before it's built. I did it

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:08.885
As like my warm-up and it was like

00:05:08.885 --> 00:05:13.188
It changed so much. Like I was not as tired.

00:05:14.404 --> 00:05:18.183
 And like, or Phil too, like my hands felt better.

00:05:18.183 --> 00:05:22.520
Like I felt like I knew like everything on my violin better.

00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:25.169
So I think I'm gonna

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.354
continue to do it. It's so chic and like, cool.

00:05:29.848 --> 00:05:31.257
yeah

00:05:38.678 --> 00:05:40.198
