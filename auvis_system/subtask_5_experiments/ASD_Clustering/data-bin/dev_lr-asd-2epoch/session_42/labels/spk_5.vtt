00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:26.847
i think u should just text him like

00:00:26.878 --> 00:00:30.810
Wait, why are you even scared? I genuinely don't understand why you're scared.

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.754
Uh-huh.

00:00:41.647 --> 00:00:46.490
Wait, let me refute that. u dont know that.'How do you know he doesn't like you?

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.170
He's responding to all your messages. He took that bread from you.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.130
I wouldn't take a bath, like a half idiot (***) no

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.371
a loaf of bread. I wouldn't take it.

00:00:58.371 --> 00:01:02.994
But he did, so. Wait, I never said that.

00:01:02.994 --> 00:01:07.871
Okay, I might take it, but then I throw it away. But he literally sent a photo of him eating it. So...

00:01:07.871 --> 00:01:10.908
okay

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:29.050
Love knows no bounds. Love has no boundaries.

00:01:35.985 --> 00:01:40.238
But what if like, what if in college you guys, you guys-

00:01:40.238 --> 00:01:43.527
you guys go to like the college and then you like

00:01:43.558 --> 00:01:46.984
Oh my god!

00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:03.610
but like it doesn't hurt to try like you don't have anyone a better priority

00:02:14.577 --> 00:02:15.878
Why?

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:24.872
That's probably how some tosses are played.

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:30.524
You guys both take Japanese 3. That's already one. You guys are in J-World.

00:02:45.712 --> 00:02:48.514
maybe

00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:59.161
Exactly, and I refuted your A and B, so there's nothing to be scared of.

00:02:59.161 --> 00:03:03.229
I'll text him for u Then text him.

00:03:07.701 --> 00:03:10.722
Okay, I'll hold you to it.

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.795
That's mean it's soon.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.825
Exactly, so (***)

00:03:57.752 --> 00:04:02.747
I can feel it in my bones. And once that happens...

00:04:02.747 --> 00:04:04.839
u will be texting him

00:04:07.198 --> 00:04:11.198
because if its happen i am gonna text him

00:04:27.617 --> 00:04:30.942
Exactly so that's like all the more reason

00:04:41.104 --> 00:04:42.758
I sure hope you do.

00:05:02.214 --> 00:05:05.116
There's a lot of scenarios that are good though.

00:05:12.272 --> 00:05:15.731
Is that really that bad?

00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:25.113
What he's he's probably just not a message like like a lot of people I look

00:05:25.113 --> 00:05:30.109
You and I are like chronic message lockers, but other people aren't.

00:05:35.745 --> 00:05:40.250
wait that's true like i told you like sometimes i replied it in my head and i am like..

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.806
and then I don't actually reply what if he did that too and I didn't realize

00:05:47.642 --> 00:05:50.967
Yeah, but what if I don't realize? What if you didn't realize?

00:05:53.532 --> 00:05:54.779
Exactly.

00:06:00.601 --> 00:06:03.758
I'm gonna keep talking about Mitchell.

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:12.837
ohh right.

00:06:14.186 --> 00:06:19.181
That makes you seem like a stalker

00:06:19.181 --> 00:06:24.176
If you post something about it, you can tell.

00:06:24.176 --> 00:06:27.349
So, I'm gonna hold you to it.

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:31.010
carti drops The album

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.517
or lamb chops an album or he posts about like track 

00:06:35.517 --> 00:06:36.815
And you know I will.

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:44.882
You can pretend you're in shock.

00:06:48.628 --> 00:06:53.623
Well it depends on what you post, but we'll think of something.

00:07:00.592 --> 00:07:04.541
Wait, you can ask about J-boy. Ask about J-boy.
