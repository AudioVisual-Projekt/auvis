WEBVTT

00:01:00.343 --> 00:01:04.647
Haaa..Haaa...Um, I don't know who that is actually.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:07.802
Um...I wasn't aware of that topic.

00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:12.796
So on this topic of love lives lives

00:01:18.012 --> 00:01:21.504
I know! I know! I know! I play them all!

00:01:21.504 --> 00:01:23.311
I put him on!

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:32.827
No, but, but, feel the, uh, like the...

00:01:32.781 --> 00:01:36.173
Like the, what do you call it? the...

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:40.465
progress like the development gradual development..Oh!

00:01:40.488 --> 00:01:41.451
Yeah.

00:01:44.758 --> 00:01:46.919
Okay..oh

00:01:52.318 --> 00:01:54.934
Yeah, but maybe he just likes lamb.

00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:03.270
Yeah..No, because I was thinking like, oh.

00:02:03.247 --> 00:02:08.225
If he already liked Lamp before I was like, oh yeah, I like Lamp.

00:02:09.076 --> 00:02:11.690
I love lamp.

00:02:12.163 --> 00:02:16.854
Yeah. Hmm hmmm... Yeah.

00:02:16.854 --> 00:02:20.347
and also the pokemon story i posted that

00:02:20.347 --> 00:02:24.162
At first like...I posted about TCGP first.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:25.492
Umm

00:02:26.305 --> 00:02:27.958
yeah he's a copycat

00:02:29.122 --> 00:02:34.118
Oh, and I'm like the alpha like you? So..

00:02:39.906 --> 00:02:44.192
Haaa....Yeah, I definitely agree.

00:02:44.192 --> 00:02:48.511
Is that what you would do in that situation? Yeah, I wouldn't either.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.861
I don't think it's being presented. I think it's like, um...

00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:02.855
like like you know like when you see short people and then you're like

00:03:02.855 --> 00:03:06.146
You know, and then you try to like take it away from them.

00:03:06.146 --> 00:03:10.264
And then and then they do like the stupid grabby hands.

00:03:10.264 --> 00:03:12.271
Hey give me...that's how it feels like

00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:21.722
Take it from you. Oh, is there anything going on in your love life? Hmm

00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:24.523
Woah...hoo...hoo..What?

00:03:24.523 --> 00:03:27.460
Who are you? who are you?

00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:31.998
Why are you so hesitant to answer?

00:03:32.521 --> 00:03:35.964
Oh! Bro's smiling.

00:03:36.775 --> 00:03:39.845
Oh, there's an anyways is it right?

00:03:42.766 --> 00:03:47.355
He did clove up! he did clove up

00:03:51.081 --> 00:03:52.419
Thats sure

00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:59.472
Hey, but didn't J-Bon do J-ble as well? But he's like-

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:03.588
Not loser. She's a- oh...ok

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.904
Oh, ok. it's the... it's the...

00:04:08.904 --> 00:04:13.730
Not loser aura, but the deep inside....kind of

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.967
So, maybe that's true.

00:04:17.967 --> 00:04:20.566
and

00:04:20.495 --> 00:04:24.713
But it's weird because we live like six hours away.

00:04:24.783 --> 00:04:25.897
That's like weird.

00:04:27.736 --> 00:04:29.684
Haaa haaa

00:04:29.813 --> 00:04:33.963
Love has no boundaries...ummm

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.000
Oh, oh, oh, after this?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.219
What, what, what would I say hypothetically?

00:04:49.996 --> 00:04:52.611
I was thinking Cardi.

00:04:52.611 --> 00:04:55.480
Playboy Cardi has been kind of...

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.331
Been edging a drop soon.

00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:02.668
So, and I know he likes Playboi Carti. I also indulge.

00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:05.639
and the fondness of Playboy Card here.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.506
So I was thinking oh when cardi drops

00:05:08.506 --> 00:05:13.030
I Am Music, which is his new album that he's been teasing for a while.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.024
I should be like, oh my god, this is so good guys!

00:05:18.024 --> 00:05:19.999
And like start plotting.

00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:26.242
Yeah. I know...I know

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.944
It's like okay, like what do you even say out of nowhere out of nothing?

00:05:35.828 --> 00:05:40.739
 Probably music, music (***) glam, hardly

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:43.218
Limp's easy.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.653
Haah!

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.501
Yeah. Yeah, for real. For realsies.

00:05:52.501 --> 00:05:56.956
Limp is good though. Yeah, but I feel like

00:05:56.956 --> 00:05:59.874
Lamp is very basic.

00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:07.019
Yeah. A new album.

00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:10.269
I am music, yeah.

00:06:12.023 --> 00:06:13.291
Yeah!

00:06:13.932 --> 00:06:17.694
I will definitely, I will definitely consider doing that.

00:06:17.694 --> 00:06:22.689
Yeah, you will be watching me..um

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:26.740
No, no, no, don't worry I can do it

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.911
No no no I am going to tweet

00:06:29.911 --> 00:06:33.946
I mean, tweet then, wow.

00:06:34.822 --> 00:06:39.817
Um...Wow, I think that that is...and a

00:06:39.724 --> 00:06:44.331
idea that I am NOT pro.

00:06:44.425 --> 00:06:47.377
I am not for, I'm not for that idea.

00:06:47.377 --> 00:06:51.833
They pro the pro

00:06:53.251 --> 00:06:56.204
I feel...No, it's like...Haaa

00:06:56.204 --> 00:07:01.047
It's awkward though, no? Because when you think about it, you're like, oh my god. This..
