00:01:05.897 --> 00:01:07.018
huhummm

00:01:11.202 --> 00:01:12.652
Aaaan ohhhh

00:01:12.696 --> 00:01:16.729
I think like the piece that my teacher assigned me 

00:01:13.437 --> 00:01:14.330
humm

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.266
Do you know Cha-Sung's poem?

00:01:19.255 --> 00:01:23.490
oh yeah yeah yeah she recommended that and then i think also like

00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:27.646
to go on 

00:01:27.563 --> 00:01:30.415
would be..Yeah? Yeah?     

00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:35.035
ssshh...

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.340
Hmmm

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.766
Haaa...

00:01:50.057 --> 00:01:51.931
It is. Oh, really?

00:01:50.058 --> 00:01:51.886
yes

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:58.124
Yes, yes.

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:03.065
Aaahan

00:02:05.312 --> 00:02:07.928
I feel like if you're like at a certain level...

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:11.201
that's when you play that's what my teacher told me

00:02:11.201 --> 00:02:15.201
Cuz like everyone plays it in France, but like barely anyone

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:19.758
plays at least Chanson, like Tigon more often, but yeah.

00:02:26.334 --> 00:02:27.770
mmmm

00:02:35.975 --> 00:02:36.987
oh Really?

00:02:39.872 --> 00:02:41.881
I think I've only seen high schoolers.

00:02:44.383 --> 00:02:48.125
Haaa...But they were like there you go they went to like Julliard Columbia

00:02:48.146 --> 00:02:53.057
so they're like also you know those kind of yeah yeah 

00:02:53.187 --> 00:02:55.971
What about you? 

00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.030
Yeah

00:03:10.262 --> 00:03:12.160
Oh!..hoo..haa

00:03:27.656 --> 00:03:29.482
yeah

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:31.948
Uh-oh.

00:03:40.858 --> 00:03:43.980
We were talking about that too. Yeah, yeah. 

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:58.968
ha uhhhhh

00:04:26.894 --> 00:04:31.888
When you ask, I learned this. I learned my lesson, but don't directly ask.

00:04:31.888 --> 00:04:36.513
like what do you think like you should ask like how much time do you think it would like take for me to like

00:04:36.513 --> 00:04:40.257
reach this piece that I want to play so it's like he feels like

00:04:40.257 --> 00:04:44.543
He's controlling the conversation and the input, rather than like, it's just you.

00:04:44.543 --> 00:04:49.134
Yeah, he doesn't like when you discuss with other people before coming to him.

00:04:49.134 --> 00:04:52.612
Yeah, cuz that's

00:04:55.918 --> 00:04:59.750
mmm yeah yeah

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:13.115
yeah

00:05:17.168 --> 00:05:18.994
yeah

00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:21.083
sshhhh

00:05:21.957 --> 00:05:25.162
Jihyo's like pretty open with like whatever.

00:05:25.162 --> 00:05:28.133
She's like way more open, but I think unless it's like

00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:31.845
For example, like me jumping to Brahms right now, obviously it's like, I know.

00:05:31.845 --> 00:05:35.254
But like, other than that, she's like really (***) good.

00:05:35.254 --> 00:05:40.198
They have to like discuss, they have to like get together in order for me to start something.

00:05:40.198 --> 00:05:42.054
mmmmm

00:05:42.693 --> 00:05:44.027
mam

00:05:47.253 --> 00:05:48.350
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:00.376
ohhhh

00:06:17.651 --> 00:06:18.850
hahaaaaa

00:06:42.924 --> 00:06:43.806
yeah

00:06:43.902 --> 00:06:47.681
I feel like...masters, you're like a master student too. 

00:06:47.681 --> 00:06:50.989
I feel like they would let you have more input.

00:06:59.784 --> 00:07:01.572
haa
