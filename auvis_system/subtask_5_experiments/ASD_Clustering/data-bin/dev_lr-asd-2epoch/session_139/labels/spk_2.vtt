I found it in like an old event in like 2016.

No, it's still around. Like it's a public game.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.969
like It was part of what like a Roblox event. There was an item you could get by doing stuff in it.

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.311
But I got addicted to it, cuz I like just going my name.

00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:35.305
And like even in Minecraft to this day, I still do prison sometimes.

00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:47.082

Wait, guys, do you know a breaking point?

00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:48.141
It's the one where like all the players are like in a dark room around a table and there's like a single lamp

00:04:48.022 --> 00:04:50.280
And it's like a gun gets passed around

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.080

Steam game Hot Times forensic mafia.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.979
But it makes like  a lot more complicated stuff. It's an add-on for like a (***) 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.830
And that's like a second of every party to the townies.

00:06:01.712 --> 00:06:05.356
