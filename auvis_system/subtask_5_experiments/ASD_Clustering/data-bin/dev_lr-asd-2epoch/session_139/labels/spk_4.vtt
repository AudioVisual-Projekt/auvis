WEBVTT

00:00:15.695 --> 00:00:18.057
Yeah

00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:30.844
okay

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.689
I remember that. That was like the highlight.

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:07.603
I don't (***) it was like...

00:01:07.603 --> 00:01:11.366
I thought it was boring. I thought there was like no plot.

00:01:22.993 --> 00:01:28.026
So, so, so, what are books to me?

00:01:29.963 --> 00:01:34.872
What? Walk to moon? I've never heard of that.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.676
Yeah'

00:01:48.053 --> 00:01:50.145
I never read that.

00:01:49.858 --> 00:01:51.101
Yeah

00:01:53.014 --> 00:01:55.157
I think I'm winning because I don't want to read it.

00:01:59.898 --> 00:02:01.029
Okay.

00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:13.769
I thought I was eight.

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.394
That's like one book? Two books per year?

00:02:18.394 --> 00:02:21.424
Four? 

00:02:26.037 --> 00:02:30.156
I hit an animal for him. So boring. 

00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:35.521
Oh Yeah

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:46.862
all animals are equal but some are more equal than others

00:02:46.862 --> 00:02:50.929
That's the only line that I know. Hahaha

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:57.634
Haahaahaa..

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.648
You guys ever read that one basketball one?

00:03:08.648 --> 00:03:11.162

00:03:11.162 --> 00:03:14.672

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:24.442
I liked it. I-

00:03:24.442 --> 00:03:29.437
I don't remember much. I remember someone died and they were sad. Yeah, the dad died.

00:03:29.437 --> 00:03:33.132
Yeah.I-

00:03:33.132 --> 00:03:36.878
i remember i read the first few chapters and it was all the poem format

00:03:36.878 --> 00:03:39.394
I was like, when's it gonna turn a chapter?

00:03:39.394 --> 00:03:43.240
Haha.. all that of it was (***)

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.215
but the way they conveyed it was pretty nice, like the story still made sense

00:03:49.215 --> 00:03:51.121
Wait, what? Intruder?

00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:57.483
Ummm..It's like a little story game.

00:03:57.483 --> 00:04:00.335
Guys, we reached Terabithia.

00:04:00.335 --> 00:04:03.170
You did?

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.110
Yeah, just yours now

00:04:11.524 --> 00:04:16.148
I forgot what happened. Was that the one with the spray paint?

00:04:18.627 --> 00:04:21.159
Maybe.

00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:28.938
Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking of the wrong one.

00:04:28.938 --> 00:04:31.251
That's how good she is.

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:34.068
Yeah.

00:04:35.114 --> 00:04:39.383
Wait, I read some book about first school. It was like someone puts spray paint.

00:04:39.383 --> 00:04:43.316
Spray paint in someone else's eyes.I don't even remember what she (***)

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:47.230
I think there is (***) in the bottom of the water

00:04:54.655 --> 00:04:58.520
Hahaha.. Thank you for clarifying.

00:05:17.523 --> 00:05:19.247
wow

00:05:19.368 --> 00:05:21.487
That's so sad.

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.292
That was genuine by the way. That's sad.

00:05:31.056 --> 00:05:33.047
You guys need a wrinkle in time?

00:05:35.003 --> 00:05:39.054
Uhhh... Yeah.

00:05:41.147 --> 00:05:46.141
Yeah, just cause it was a woman, right? So he was like, I don't want to read anymore.

00:05:46.141 --> 00:05:47.256
what?

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.765
Of course you can't wrap your mind around complex concepts like that.

00:05:54.765 --> 00:05:55.422
that

00:05:56.537 --> 00:06:01.076
That too. That was what I told you about that too.

00:06:08.873 --> 00:06:10.914
He just doesn't pay attention.
