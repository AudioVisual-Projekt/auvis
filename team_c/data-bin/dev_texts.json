    "Superhero? oh!, oh Ah And like, DC or Marvel? DC um See, Loki, I only care about Batman in the entirety of the DC, like... Fragile. Oh, I love those! See I love that he only cares about Batman and his family Everybody else can low-key just like disappear laboratory can So technically he has four. Five cannons on it. There's his oldest, they craze He only he has one biological son. What biological? Huh, No, it's like it's kind of a joke where everybody's like, oh he just takes in children like he will Hero kidnaps them. Literally, that's how it happens every time he's like Batman. He finds a kid on the street. And then Oh, you're poor and you're also like ah underprivileged I'm gonna Adopt you now. You have no choice. Huhu, not low-key, because his basement is a bathtub. And a lot of people like to also consider all the other younger kids that he like interacts with are also his children, so If you consider the fanbase, they're like 20 children, basically. 20 children. There's only one character? Ohh!...... yeah Does you like the TV shows? Like, WandaVision and, like, animals and TV shows. I know, they're all locked behind Disney+, Huh, huh, ha. They're like, it's not our problem. Oh yeah. mmhmm mmhmm They like then, Deterbication. And she just scared ***, your size, yes.. Only am, so I'm Honestly, lowkey, I think it's Marvel has it best when it comes to movies? Not right now, but.. before, like and then, but like When it comes to like series, I think DC kind of has it in the bag. Because DC focuses. Like the movies suck. I watched a few Batman movies. The only one i like is Robert Pattinson and is like Because they didn't focus on the fact that he's Batman. They actually like the story. mm, It's like, what was it, 2022? Yeah, 2022. Not that one, it's only featuring Batman. And ah whatever. Yeah, I heard about that one too. I think that's maybe the sequel. Cuz they're gonna add on to it. But The movie is just it is sucks so bad. I I watched a few of them, especially like The Flash. What is it? The Justice League? And I watched them, it's like, one, the action's really bad, two... Their power scaling is crazy. Like they're either like weak or like really weak. oh really strong when they need to be. And it's like, so entertaining. you You know Green Lantern? He Green lantern is limited Fine imagination, But all he does is like Gun? Yeah fly and gun and that's about it or giant rock and roll You could you could literally do anything like a wall sometimes, a wall or a boulder. And it's really boring, and it's really sad. So that's why I'm So, The live-action ones, especially the live-action movies. They're really bad. I don't like the casting. I hate the casting a lot. bad and the costumes are also really bad I think I'm just really picky, but I don't like IRL costumes when it comes to superheroes because they never look like Superheroes. They look like costumes. Like you could tell. uh ha They don't look real. Yeah, I know, the moment they actually look good you believe like, yeah, I don't believe this is a costume. I mmhmm Oh yeah. Like for a costume To be good, I need to be able to watch a movie and not be distracted by the costume and how bad it is. It it needs to be like oh I cringe at the costume that's a bad music or it's like oh i'm not even i didn't even notice how bad the costume is That must be, it just feels magical. Yeah. That's what like that's what makes a good superhero costume. They're really good. Is it Marvel? I've seen... I've seen clips yeah",
    "So, What's your favorite superhero? Favourite superhero? Oh, DC, DC I keep saying that, but I'm not really conscious. See, I don't know who is in it. Wait, who's in his family? Biological? Why why are they spawning in? Is this kind of a joke? Like, he just finds a child on the street like*** It's like, It's like those memes. Do you know the meme where it's like, oh I have children in my bed? Like, that's just Batman. Huh Yeah, I have 13 children in my basement. 20 children Yeah. Oh,,, Um.. I'm like I'm same as you like I low-key There's only one chair. No, I care only about you. Personally because like that's the one that I most familiar with because of like ***I don't read the comics that much. I think I've seen him on TV shows. TV shows like Wandavision like So for WandaVision... I.... Of all scene, I've only seen some scenes of it online, but then for... Animated TV shows. I know there's like Disney Plus ones *** evil corporation I'm really into like the Avengers movie I also like some other individual ones. I'm more into like the group ones because I think they're really interesting, but it's so funny like there's like this joke running like this running joke where it's like when there's a world's Like, a world-threatening like villain? but it's not the Avengers' movie, so they don't show up. Like you know um Spider-Man, like the most recent ones? ah like they're like literally about to freaking They're so, they're literally about to... like something like destroy the world and the Avengers just don't show up. Which is then in the time, or It's like*** Literally not a doll. Not only him, yeah, it's only him. Yeah, phase, phase like two three Because Yeezy focuses so only Only one i like is Oh yeah. It's like, It's like, which one? 22 phase, *** Okay, I only know there's a new one coming up was like Robert Pattison may be Yeah, I heard that was bad. I heard there's a lot of problems *** It's like, when you have superpowers, one of we Use them, creatively, we're sticking to the same three skills. God, *** *** I'm so mad because you could literally spawn lich fraggers. *** Like an entire dragon. Yeah, to choose this to... Use the gardens, he just like make some***, he just ahh.. and... You party *** Wait, that's what I really like um Marvel ones, cuz they're kind of funny. Like, ***yeah Like, but I know Scarlet was. like her dress in ah Multiverse of Madness which is the one Where she kind of goes crazy. um, like her costume in that looks so good. Like her hair, matches that The real need yeah It feels so natural. Yeah. That's why I really like um the marvel Marvelous costume. I truely did this. Do you know Ms. Marvel? Like, i know you want to see what it looks like. So there's like three women",
    "Mm so, kick it to see again. Yeah, yeah. It's going great. I love making pieces I have one that I'm supposed to make tomorrow. I reply*** yes today, I was supposed to make one yesterday, right? and then I buff my boss here at school. Ssss. It it, who is going ah to robotics? Freshman, had the worst, single handedly the worst rhythm and attendance. Actually, Ranjin's attendance wasn't bad. Millen's was horrible. He was gone for like a week like three weeks before talent show and he was has like probably worse rhythm Second worst is, hence is, Tristan Apodario, but he's fine because he actually... plays Taiko like outside of Taiko, like plays the game and has a sense of rhythm. No one does it? And then Naranjan, his attendance was great, but like For all the meetings we pulled up to, they were regularly like two hour practices. It was just me, him, and Kai. And then it would still happen where he wouldn't be able to fix like a single mistake. Like we were gonna have the same mistake the entire time for him and he wouldn't be able to figure it. Oh my god, well, how this sent *** oh cuz he sent a free drive*** He volunteered for that. He volunteered for it. He was like, you know what? Actually, Tycho won't be at that much of a deal. I mean, bro. But Niranjan got out of the way. He resigned from being a coach. Guess who did it? Oh, Milan got forced to step off anyway because he was sick during ILTs. But he still keeps trying to do robotics when he really Didn't he do, which was a giant They're both programmers from Platform 2. Oh, did he *** a part of this? Let me see. So there's performance. which includes Taekwondo and there's culture which is gardening and stuff and I think Activities, camps, maybe? Yeah, because your DOP, DOC, DOI. Activities is like the actual club stuff with like General meetings and a banquet and just the stuff that actually happens that people see really Culture ha works with them, I guess. And then also there's other stuff like exchange I think. I don't know. I don't pay attention during cabin crews very much, I'm not gonna lie. Oh yeah, just the outline. No like, Jane and Caller are great paladins. Like they leave the meeting as well and like keep stuff organized compared to whatever the hell is going on for robotics. Because that's my perspective, I see this and I see that So as far as my time is concerned, this is very organized. We have meetings make it a lot easier to get things done And it's also a lot more consistent than whatever the hell robotics is going on. Yeah, I don't know what was going on that. I remember last year it was consistent because they said like oh yeah no just every other week on Monday or whatever And this year, I don't know what our current... President's arguing. So it just FTC meeting. It's fair enough to be a romantic scene, but also, the rest of the club does matter? Because a lot of people rely on it for SNHS stuff. And also people, there's a lot of like just middle schoolers back here. because they also kind of just put the entirety of middle school on hold for FEC season you Which they alright, FLO season over. No more FLO stuff. ah mentors didn't do anything, I don't think And then we also like we also did a lot less general meetings. Yeah, I wonder who's fault that was. But then, like, that's also a thing a lot of those boys pull up to because they don't have anything else to do with their lives. And that also just quite doesn't cook them and ever wants might have considerably less of a future in two years. No, cuz  already heard about like, they're struggling with mentors for RPIX and Robocamp? For sure, I don't think they are anymore but like It worked for a bit. I think a lot of middle schoolers who are dedicated just like are just grasping for every straw they can and then that's how they get input and stuff The food's a lot, also a lot, lot of people who just aren't interested in that anymore. to probably would have been otherwise",
    "So, oh yeah. Oh, how does it feel being... Um, Tycho head I heard... I heard um... Yes, couldn't get a piece? Oh, I see, I see. um so oh tell me everything about the taiko stuff that happened during a talent show correct ohh Oh, I see, I see. ohhp Dude, I, like, Kai started, like... I was like ranting and they like screenshot it and like showed me the messages. And that I like what Millie said I like the discord server and then like uhm like, oh my god, I'm so sorry. I can't make it. I got like robot robotics and stuff Huh That that's a lot of commitment though. ohh ohh.... yeah yeah They're both in a main team, right? 5-4-2? Oh, I see, I see. So... Ahh, well, tell me about the different KKC departments. Yes... I see I always see like the the footnotes from cabi meetings because I think period So it's like like you guys always have like ice breakers Yeah, they leave the outline. Yeah. yeah Yeah. Oh yeah, dude, I remember like before I quit you're like Three cabi meetings, like total. And I quit like a little bit after second semester began. Do you guys still, like do you guys have frequent cabinet meetings? Right? Oh, no one moved to the yeah I was told from I'm an insider source who shall not be named Um that instead of doing cabinet meetings they do have quite frequently um head meetings. For like a publicity um like builders and programmers. Like instead of cabinet, those are the people. Yeah, specifically in 542. yeah Yeah. yeah Mine, yeah. yeah Yeah. Hooray! Um...Yeah, so happy I quit Oh yeah, really they're struggling, What? Robocamping? yeah I think because of bad leadership.",
    "Pocket edition. Pcket edition I played both. I played *** Yeah. Huhu Yeah. Stravet is better Mm mm Is all you're gonna do, are you gonna just mock me the whole time? ***Let us do more Yeah. Just a little discussion so, Huhuh ch ahm... *** Ahw, I think Java is great. Because, you know, like survival and bedrock, everything's like given to you. ***Java is better*** *** No, it's different.

    "KKC. hmm hmm yeah or We can talk about robotics. uh hahahahha I don't have anything I really want to talk about. Okay, so how did the caveat go? Are you confident? What did you apply for? dealing ?How much have you done for club? Like general meetings. okay? some secondary position. I don't know, they might've stole your idea. Who knows? They might just throw you a silver, who knows. You can't just get that. no chance hahahah Are you gonna do robotics? is that it? I don't know, maybe when he becomes president. It could. I can still go into committee and just push really hard for it. But at the same time, I feel like Sedan is too good at interviews. Even if he's a bozo in practice. They're good at interviews but they are bad at every competitions Because that's just how robotics works with (****) Last year, but current people. They suck. They got all their judging practices. That's what they're good at, just lying. But as far as actually doing stuff... Well, they don't check if you actually do stuff. Like, they aren't gonna check if you actually did something in Libya. All they know is that, what did you say, Eric? He tried to interrogate you but in the end... It's like college apps. They can't check your logs that much I'm supposed to be DOE and I'm supposed to be making it but Mon is just kind of pushing ahead of it. Kind of carrying the entire thing. cause i... He was peeing for a couple of stuff and I just... Alt-tab, and alt-tab back. (****) It's supposed to start next Monday, but then it's like... They want to keep the electronic stuff on Fridays when I'm busy at the table. So it's gonna be really funny.  And I just do not do any of the electronic stuff for them. I do all the cat stuff but then I think it might end up just being... someone's gonna do like (****) Yeah, last year's stuff yeah I remember I wanted to check kept checking stuff on the discord server because I never could actually go to the meetings of the FEC and I never saw anything posted. Like you said, alright guys, we're having something today or hey guys, we're having something today. Here's the lusher notes. I mean it's fair enough at the same time. There's a submissions tab, I feel like there's stuff meant to be done with that, I'm just never pulling through with it. so i dont know what happened You should do performance. but you just go into account and show or id like at any time or even nso You should do counter id  NSO Fair enough. Maybe if they went out there. I think the seat might have one after if we get, because we're probably going to get invited. (****) they are looking like something i dont know huh? okay. i was carrying so hard. Like, how come I'm being a bum? Like, even in real life? Half the time, I just wait until the latest I can to do it. But then like Kai was just like doing everything way ahead of time and actually practicing the dance. So I feel really bad for them because they're doing like everything I should, but I want to- . I want to go home and game. (***) since 9th grade I was pulling all nighters in 9th grade for Flora's Outlines. and then in 10th grade for stat homework and last year was still math homework. Like I always put all nighters because I want to just keep playing games and it's like oh 2 am Maybe I should start doing homework. And that's been my entire lifestyle for the past four years. Probably earlier too actually. Yeah earlier too actually. . I really need to start doing  setting up. If I say I'll do it in college, that's a bad idea. I won't. It needs to start now with Taichung and Jabul. But at the same time... It's one button to open game.",
    "Oh, KKC? Oh, we're talking about KKC now? Okay. Oh wait, I had something to say but then I forgot. um okay wait It'll come to me. huhh Christ(****) um DOA yeah I show up I know i will see i wil see I haven't, I've only drafted so far. DOC but I don't have a sense on DOC at all. They might tie it up for a chance. Oh, whoopsies. umm no Why would I do robotics to identify all you idiots? That's not gonna happen. Is it? I feel like it's only going to be a single president next year You could. Oh yeah. yeah thats true I feel like the thing with robotics is that they literally like They're so bad at nurturing. What is this? Like they have their priorities completely offset. yeah It wasn't always like that, huh? It wasn't always like that though Like last year. Oh yeah. yeah That's true thats true um How about that new program starting up, the ED? for real? Oh, okay. That's fair, that's fair. i see i see i see Wait, so have I started? Because sign-ups are open, isn't it? yeah the thing is like (**) or like the the previous like imagery stuff or whatever the program name is called. yeah. Like, they always say, oh, we're gonna do this, we're gonna do that, but then, like, nothing happened Especially like postseason Yeah. So our other topic is KKCU. Um... What's for next year, dude? It's too late.  No. yeah If there is and I'll do it so it's like if not, oh well,like You know, YOLO or whatever. Oh, YOLO as in you only live once. just for clarification huh? okay um soo ayy so i  mean.. about your favorite thing about being co-taiko head. Kai's really good. Bro, you should step up. You should step up. Oh yeah, is senioritis hitting hard? (***) Yeah. yeah",
    "So... um Can I pick up where I left off? Okay, so for WandaVision her costume looked really really natural because they stressed the fabric enough so it didn't look like it completely new, but it just looked used and that made sense to me. It was like, It was like her superhero costumes. It was like, really like... i didnt feel like  it was like a plastic you fabric like a fake fabric that was nice. yeah It's a little too shiny. Yes like... I feel like they should be like... Like prop makers should be able to like make chess plates and stuff because I feel like they would make it realistic right. yeahh Let's talk about let's talk about the movie right Okay, so like...ummm My favorite avengers  movie is I think Age of Ultron I just really like how they aren't at each other's throats. And they're working as a team. yeahh Have you watched it? i Don't I'm okay with the Lego movie. Like, I just, I don't know. I haven't watched it in a while. I need a refresher, but I'll probably like it. i Like Lego Batman I love Lego Batman. I was like watching Michael Batman the other day and I was like, wow. This actually is really funny. It's a comedy for real. Are there any other movies, like Ghibli movies? Are there any Ghibli movies you're into? Ghibli. Studio Ghibli. Okay, um, I also like it. It's good. Are you looking at him with the black hair? That's a hot take. That's a hot take. That's huge. It looks like he's gonna like steal your whole life. I mean, like, he's naturally long. Yeah, he's European. They are all european It's cute. I like it. I heard like the original book was kind of scary tho It's like, it's like Disney princesses versus the Grimm's Brothers. Like, for how is it a castle, I think, um... I really like Sophie, she was very, she was like she feels really silly like i think she adjusted a little too quickly She just accepted it. Yeah. Like she doesn't have an existential crisis at some point? Like, she doesn't feel like the main character in that movie. We don't really get to see what she's thinking, we just see what's happening. Howl's Moving Castle. She's just a storyteller. Also, I feel like it's so off-putting that... He was like 30 and she was just like 18. yeahh (****) Like, you know Snow White, like 16 and like 32. like he's literally twice her age no actually It's still kind of different. And that's. They were on something. They were on something. Do you have a favorite Disney princess movie? Sleeping Beauty, oh that was so cute. I love the Maleficent live action. oh they were so pretty oh my god i love the cgi in that one It's getting worse Like the first and second were both really good. I haven't watched that one. i havent watched Oh, Cruella? Oh, you were totally talking about that Dalmatian one. like (****) What was CGI in that one? Other than the obvious... like.. That's a lot.",
    "ohhhh So I noticed with a lot of superhero here  with their costumes When it's like something hot like bottle or like ...It looks like plastic. its like.. You look fake. You look like really bad styrofoam cosplay. They need to make it really good. and Like, they spent like a hundred billion dollars on this movie. It's like... But it doesn't look like you did. It looks like you spent...hmmhm hmm what? Oh my gosh! thats crazy i think we were like teamwork was ur teamwork You like the Lego movie What do you mean you're okay with it? It's so funny. I rewatched all the Lego movies. movies like Ninjago, Batman, and the original Lego movie outside. You guys are so funny. Why did I hate that? I hated all of those movies when I was younger. And then I watched it again. These are actually really good movies. They're really funny. you It's a good movie. It's a comedy for real. what? jabian?umm I don't know, I don't really have a favorite favorite. honestly i feel like um (****) i just really like them no, see how I like his blonde hair. He looks like a shyster. He looks a lot better with the black hair in my opinion Because when I see him with the blonde hair, it's like, he's gonna scam me. He's definitely going to scam me. You don't like those snake oil sellers thats what he looks like.The black hair he looks more normal hahaha But he's European. He's actually blonde. I think it's a really nice movie. original book? I know the original book is very different. hahhaha really? Oh i like it No, I was like damn you just accepted the fact that you're an old lady and now you're just working in this house I was. Like, Lowkey , the urgency in her... in her own movie it's like it's kind of not there It's all about Howl. I mean, it is his movie, Howl's movie yeahh so but it's like we started with ummm We started with her, so... No, it's it's the age gap like see if I did another age I could just like oh, she's like 24. He's like 28. That's fine but.. As I almost twice your age Actually, no, that wasn't the... Actually, I'm gonna check you on that. That's actually over exaggerated. The original technically was like 14 and 30 something. But they lowered, they changed it. So she was a little older. She was like, what, 17, 16? And the guy is probably... They said it was like it was like it was like 19 or 20 So the gap isn't as, see, it's still bad, but it's not as bad as 14 and 16 and 30 something. It's still really bad But you know what? I accepted because back then they were strange anyways. They were freaky. They're on something. Is there a Disney princess movie? ummm.. I don't see it. Objectively like you Oh, the Maleficent. but i lowkey Think CGI for Disney movies has kind of like yeah I think Maleficent was like peak And then everything else was like... They were really good. and I think... The Dalmatian one like um I think she's okay. She's okay. I think she low-key ate She was really, yeah, she was cute. Not the original, not the original but the villain when she got her own I don't think there's... I don't know. I just think the costumes are really nice.",
    "Oh, do you wanna... I think I was talking about the costumes cinderella And so that's why... No, I mean the costumes it wasn't always the CGI that got me but I think the costumes and the design of the characters I would love it. It's so good. Because when it comes to live action Disney costumes, they all look bad. I saw the Snow White dress and I was like, no what did they do to my baby girl. I know, right? They literally made the worst... Dress Also, I heard they're changing the plot. You know what I don't get about... the whole like we are gonna change this disney (**) So they're more like empowered But the thing is, most of them are already technically empowered women. They're just in more feminine forms and it's very strange how They have no literacy like media literacy in them because a lot of these stories about people Like, getting a better life, generally, right? Isn't that empowerment in some sort of way? and she has to be independent. She has to be girl boss. Like she makes no math. Like that type of Yeah yeah There's so many actors with dwarfism out there. It's not that hard. like one of the actresss was like oh One of the producers like that's offensive like people yeah So like I don't get why they didn't bother doing it. It's so strange. No, the actors are fine, but it's the producers that are always so strange. Or like, it's the company. i ummmm Okay, I don't like how they basically i didnt really like that Because by the time he gets, like, if there's still continue Yeah, the whole point of the ending of the book is that he goes to college. he's gonna have like yeah he's buying his own life insurance hahahah Have you seen the new, like, what was it, the new Percy Jackson stuff? show was it a show or was it like? Huh? ohhh true ur right They have two? Wait, there's no awesome way. Is this an animated one?like It's so good! No, I wasnt the first one I love Nezha and Liar. You know, like, Green Snake? And, like... ohhhhh It's so good! the first one? Oh yeah, I was like, this is a little strange How do you feel?(***) Really? It's like water and milk. The style is always strange like every time I watch it My dad and I watch it all the time and he's like, this style is very geared towards a certain audience. Didn't you hear the pause? It's kind of boring. really boring Have you seen, oh shoot, I don't know what the name of the movie is. But it's this Chinese animated movie. Oh, this is like little kid. And he has like a change into like an animal and he has like an older mentor And it's really cute. Huh? Not the monkey king. It's like an actual 2D animated. It's really cute. It's actually, I watched it and I was like, ooh, this is such a good movie. The animation's so good. The impact frames are incredible. My seats are wonderful. If I can find it, I'll show it to you. It's really good. hm?",
    "soo okay wait what? (****) I love the costume.it was so cute I do not like the new Snow White costumes. Why? Like, they could have... (****) historical and they just chose not to. Like it's so lame and like she's just it just looks so forgettable Like it's just so underwhelming for Disney Princess. Working against yourself. But she has to be independent. She's a coward. yeah like uhhh also do u like wanna be like really progressive, but then for the dwarves they use CGI dwarves instead of just actual people That's a really good opportunity. literally It's a good opportunity for them to expand their platform. You're literally supporting them. Don't hit on the actors, though. Like, I respect them. Have you watched Percy Jackson? Like, I think they're kind of okay. Like, why are they so old? Yeah. He's gonna be like 30. yeah Yeah, he's gonna be... He's so pretty. hhahahah hahahahahah Let's talk about movies. oh how do u see? Oh my gosh, I'm so obsessed is like this its tiny (****) It's so cool. Yes, it's been out since February it came to theatres in america on  february 14th Like the little, the animated 3d animated Have you watched the second one? I can't find it online yet. But I hope it does come up for like, soon. Because it was so good. ohhhh but i was (****) first ones I like the first one. I also like the first and the third one. I'm not a big fan of second one because I feel like it's huge sitting is a little jarring from like Chinese food It's a little jarred. Yeah, I didn't like that so I like the first and third because i love like I gotta kill this. I'm obsessed. I tried. I couldn't. I don't really like it. I try to watch it but again I'm not a very big fan , not stunned at all. I'm okay with water, but the Chinese animation style... thry have very weird swords they are not... No, it's very specific but it doesn't fit. like (***)  realistic stuff.its supposed to be Like it doesn't fit like realistic stuff Yeah, no lot of the... chinese stuff is very like too 2 dimensional like the main characters and stuff I have no idea. So cool. The Monkey King? That sounds cute. I love it. I love fight scenes, though. I'll take your word for it uhhhhh I've been really, really into... Oh, you know on Netflix? It used to be on Netflix. Bye.",
    "Huh? Well, I started last time, it's your turn. What? No, I did. No, I did. No, I did. Favorite at least favorite robotics. My favorite is just every time I'm up inhaling smoke or doing soldering stuff. or also every time or also uhh Every time we've won an award because it's like... We're depressed and then we just win something all of a sudden? Least favorite is any other time this season. Any other time that I've had to do robotics this season? because it's like my stuff keeps getting lost like okay i'm doing a set The whole damn mechanism gets lost. Or, uh, batteries? Battery gets lost. or the battery charger got lost once. The $150 one I bought with all of its prices. I've been probably carrying like 90% of the battery charge the entire scene. huh? I only go when I have to. If I'm not... i wasnt...The ones that are required are the judging ones. So those are the only ones I usually go to. Sometimes I just go if I'm like being I need to do a set or something but like I I haven't gone to any like that in like a hot second. Can you say that again? ohhh Team 2 specifically? It was horrible with that. Like they would just leave their food around. Like... Someone started using my water bottle as like a phone status Bro, that's my water bottle. What are you doing with it? huh? anik , goldmayor I don't understand why I feel like this. Oh yeah, and also Jen was on there unfortunately. Jen. Y'all put those built-in I don't know why. I think they just won on top of Team 1. But like, why don't you do it in a nice way, so it makes her build head. like I don't know. Yeah. Can you say that again? Why would I? I'm not doing it. I am done with robotics. After e3d. Oh wait, no, it's not supposed to do stuff for FTC. I'll procrastinate on it though, until I start getting pined about it. If I'm not getting confronted then I won't do it. alright Do you think you're gonna ever try and go back to robotics? So it's like number one abusive relationship. most toxic most abusive Neurons in secretary, right? Neurons in secretary, right? Oh, that's why they're pushing on you. Like, oh, they're busy with FTC, you are, so you can do everything. And then they're just bumming around. Don't put them in those kind of positions then, right?like The whole thing is a mess. I don't want to... I might just leave the server after I graduate because I don't know if I want to be in there and see the stuff they're having. Next year. Hey, we'll just like mute that roll. I'll make roll pings and just, yeah, I don't know. The whole thing is just a mess.",
    "So you should start with something. That's why I pointed at you. Oh, I started last time. No, I did.no Okay, so um What do you think your favorite memory has been in robotics? Favorite and least favorite. Yeah. Any other time of what?ohh Did you go to any of the after school meetings? Did you go to any of the home meetings? But I thought it's, like, not required. Cuz Mahana was telling me yeah, she was complaining because like robotics like trash your house and she was the one who had to create all of the backup Like, because Moana was telling me that, like, robotics completely, like, trashed her. And she was the one who had to clean everything back up. Who's on team 2?whos on  team 2 Yeah, don't worry I get the the vibe of the team now. Team two? oh interesting I see you are you um planning oh no you're probably not but you're probably not (****) You're probably not going to do RoboCamp this year.i think so yeah That's fair. heck no H-E-C-K-N-O My friend told me that robotics is like a god. And I was like talking about robotics the same way I talked about that guy. he's like blocking on everything its so toxic bro The most toxic- Oh, I like- Oh! Whenever I kept like I literally planned all of the days and all the stuff from the J-O meetings, right? And then they literally just... And then they're like, oh, by the way, the master calendar. The secretaries are supposed to make that. I don't even... Like, I just look over it, but the second thing is his makeup. So why are you asking me to make it when the secretaries were supposed to make it at the very start of the year? Because last year I was secretary, I was helping Chris make the master calendar too. And then on top of that, I had all of his gender names, and I talked to Johnson about it, and I was like, hey, this is okay. and I planned out what to do and then the day that the general duties actually come were actually a couple days ago. Like oh sorry can we do like this like no I don't think wecan do like this Yeah, no, no, no, no, no. It's Audit and Hoonion. yes dude right and then as soon i found i wasnt in the... okay i am just gonna lock outLike what's the point? Trying to like yeah Trying to put myself there when they obviously like don't want me there. You know what I mean? Like don't don't try to invite yourself to parties that you're that you didn't get invited to. King alumni.

I don't know, you chose the topic. Yeah, you did. I said sure. I said sure. because you suggested it sure implies that like it's okay to be gay Like, I wouldn't prefer, but I'm not really against it either. I know. Can you stop doing that? At least my forehead's not over me all the time. (****) That's five. That's five. (****) Day 5! What I enjoy most about Minecraft is... I like fishing, I already said that but... Oh I like reading the animals. And then you kill them for food. I really like killing the animals and like cooking their meat. hhahahaha hahahhaa Me too, but like, it's like.. I feel like it's just a vibe because when he opens the gate, it's like... It's like necessary for survival. So it's like just a part of the game.

I will. Okay. Nerd. I'm mocking you as part of the insult. what? I didn't say anything So, what do you enjoy the most?about minecraft Were you good at it? Are you sure it's not because you're on pocket? Like, genuinely, if you played Bedrock, like, Windows 10, like, I think it'd be easier. You do that too, and- bedrock windows 10..yeah like you're like limited(***)",
    "said in the chat. So Minecraft, right? What do you want to talk about? I didn't choose a topic it was like it was a mutual  mutual agreement. So I was expecting you provide some Oh yeah, no you can't. hahaha so So what gives you hahah So much no Clash of Clans is the one you build the base, right? You're not interested in this What were you enjoying? like clash of clans You build a base But Clash Royale, you build a deck. a deck of cards yeah but like the (****) Actually, I'm good at both But Clash of Clans, you need to invest your time in it. Why are you smiling? It's not that. It's serious though. Hey,so  how was it? That's our topic Oh, thank you So what games do you play? Like the solitaire?hahahha What's his favorite? It's not easy Also, you suck at solitaird I'm just asking. hahhaaha Tusk is my style. online You only play online. Me? I play Solitaire with Atropos. I guess. which one Broke oh I only watch. I said, um, first row, second row, second row. huh? Jamie, Gabby. Me, Sidon, Jason. jason...athreya Saw him, the third one. what? Just wondering and i dont know Only Pokemon rogue Like the one you click on the number and you color it. hahahaha That's wonderful. I'm sure you're a great artist. You sound like a great artist. What? Then why don't you play something else? Why don't you play something real real quick? Buy something you love. I like Pokemon. yeah I- I pay attention. Oh my god. yeah, I pay attention and then I was like back propagation and I'm not gonna explain it to you. Linear regression is a form of regression, so it's from like AP statistics. So you're basically trying to approximate a linear relationship between two variables. Oh, you just got burned. You just got burned. ohh its the ai quiz It's like by default I got this one. Yeah, the only person I love, DrupalGod. Like, I feel like... Everyone else? I don't glaze, but the only person I glaze is Drew Brito. yeah its not gross cause This is one they don't deserve it, right? Drupal God deserves everything. He deserves more. like i got u bro can we?",

Oh, I play... I don't play the same games as you. You play clash royale What's the difference between the two? They sound the same. No, no, no.keep going  I'll listen. Death? Oh, like hearts? Oh. thats cool so ur gonna have both? So don't ask to smell. I smelled you in my bath yesterday. It wasn't that great, but it was okay. yeah I think that's great, that you have things you enjoy. I play spider in A push. Yeah i feel like spider's better though because solitaire, that's just like laying Spider you have like more options. Spider? The one I play is one sweep? so it's all spades, right? and then you know how in Salta you have to alternate colors? In spider you just keep going and then when you run out of things Like, run out of, like, cards to move, and click on the... I think that was called the other deck and it distributes one card to everyone And then all that's messed up, I have to remake K to Ace. Yeah. Who said that? I used to be good at solids now. I was like... i use to be good at solitaire at 8th grade Yeah with actual cards I used to play with actual cards. It's like harder. Oh, I play Pokemon in AI just Like that? Who do you watch play? Wait, where do you sit in AI? second row?(***) Left or right? Second row. thats wonderful hahahah I was just wondering. yeah I play Pokemon. Well, I play other games. I used to play coloring a lot.

I was like, that looks so cool. hahahha ...he was like I don't see my daughter cry. Oh yeah. bro thats crazy Have you seen... shoot. What was it called again? You know that one, like, I don't think it's a, is it a Ghibli film? I don't think so. It's too sad for that Like the fireflies one? It's like so many fireflies. That was such a sad movie. It's... No, but the thing is... Okay. Then I'll just spoil it for you. Just spoil it for you. its really sad like they were the fireflies..Like I watched it because I saw a few reviews He's about to (****) and Oh, it was so sad. See, the beginning was so happy. oh so sweet and then ohhh Brother! Well, everybody's like actually getting part of the live. It's crazy. I've heard of it. Oh, I thought about player one It's okay, but I didn't really get the ending. like the ending..It was like... you're giving it to the people but like that was never really the issue i think you I watched it twice and I like never really got it It's really cool to watch. It's really fun. I don't know what they're trying to say. Yeah, he completes a few missions. Wow, he saved the world. And he also has a girlfriend I guess. Yeah, lowkey that girl could have done better. I know. Yeah. Mmm. she is straight... I don't know why movies add a whole love block. for when i like i like Talk to people about movies. They're like, I don't know why they added a whole like subplot where there's romance even though it's unnecessary. I know and it's like, I feel like it takes away from the room. It's also always at the sacrifice of like the female lead too. Suddenly she's like like the damsel in distress like she literally has no other personality Oh, I'm the guy's girlfriend now. Oh yeah. yeah like really but like I liked her in the beginning When she was like low-key just like struggling. When she was like talking with everybody. because  Howl wasn't in the picture just yet but then as soon as Howl howl kind of goes into the picture. and then she does like take control when she needs to but I watched Endgame first! She's a really good marble like She's like, you wanna watch Endgame with me? He's like, yeah sure, I've never seen the movies. So I literally don't know anything, and I watched Endgame. And then watch the second one. Huh? Oh absolutely, I already knew most of the lore anyways. no like Yeah I watched the first one. Yeah, like Endgame, and then... Isn't there two parts to it? Yeah, and then",
    "Oh yeah, so basically the email was detailing, hey, here are the problems. That we're having within our club. um so because you're the former president I was wondering if you could get your advice. on how to fix these problems, or if there's any advice you'd like to input or comment on. therapy love to hear so and then Perry Han sent back an email on his at MIT.edu Yeah, so you guys are kinda screwed and... A lot of these issues are very big and difficult to fix. yeah Yeah Yes, but like very gently because I was also talking to Jordan about it at one point and then i was like yo like like this like like this kind of This is like the Apparently he was on call. I mean Jordan was on call with like Merritt and like Yeah, I know, this surprised me too. And then so, Terry Conrad's like talking about it and stuff, and then Terry Conrad's like, It's not that bad though. I don't know I know i know you like bro yeah Not that bad, not that long. I don't know I remember Mohana showed it to me on her phone. I think it was maybe like a week. (****) No, but PerryHan like ignores people on Discord. oh boy and sue Nevermind, nevermind. i i just About huh? the metro what? oh yeah yeah Yeah, I can guess why. yeah yeah yeah Um, I heard mr. Domi and then new or not the new Billy The other. um other guy they were like peeping each other yeah yeah i agree no and then they're always talking about like oh yeah Back when we were in the world, all of that was like 10 plus years ago. right Back when we were in worlds, like we as an FTC made it to worlds No, I don't think so. And they're always like, yeah, we're so award-winning. Wait, give me like Ian Hudson like Wait, where did he end up going to? Um, yeah. Dude, look. Like I feel like the analogy is Sadat is like a dad who left the world. the club and he's like cheating with his secondary family A.K.A. CSI and then huh? Oh my gosh, how many different families does he have?okay then Definitely.um and then and then .... she is Trying to make up for life",
    "Yeah, because no one else wants to talk with you. So basically told them resign. Leave the club? Let someone else do it? And they'll probably love her. At least cancel out all the old stuff that you personally started and turned into an issue. That's so bad. Like it's not even, like, why, why would, first of all... Why wouldn't they go to the coach or the advisors, right? Why did they go to the alumni? who's currently a college freshman trying to get through his classes That are like insanely hard and has better things to do than worry about his high school that club that he Graduated from already I should have had like no stuff left to do with them and that's It's like they're still pulling him back in. Do you know how long it took for him to respond? Okay, it would've been worse if like, he tried ignoring them and then they sent a follow-up saying... Please respond soon. A week? okay i think he might have been trying to ignore it but then he like remembered it That or they DM him on Discord. Who did you hear that from? Can you guess why he might have that opinion? It's like, I DM, he'll respond. If that guy responds He responds . Like this guy DMed him about Tcap last year and he respond about the Metro Internship. Metro like and he responded to price Can you guess why he might not want to respond to Bowie and Siri? Yeah, he responds , he checks discord. like he's on discord like normally i think but it's like There's no read receipt, read receipt, so you can easily ignore anyone. But they might have tried DMing him and they said, all right, I'll just do the email. Oh yeah, did he keep trying to pull new coaches? because I guess they don't like Mr. Demi even though are things supposed to be that student run, we're mostly doing stuff ourselves, we get occasional advice from our mentor. Let them do like, don't like that or post because they suck. And so they're trying to put a new coach to do everything for them. And it's like, that's not how it's supposed to go. and they're just like throwing everything away. Trying to make Whitney into a thing that it's not. meant to be like i think it's not was not has not ever been known to me Back when who wait back when who was where? We? They were never there. And also that's and then you're trying to go against the things that have made it happen Thank you No, like they think, like Sheena is not gonna be the next Ian Hudson. Ian Hudson was the guy who was held in... Sophomore year, junior year, senior year and he took them to awards all three years. That was Ian Hudson. I don't remember, but he did that. and then it's like they keep trying to do stuff that they can't do they keep looking back at the history of water but it's like They don't know to see the culture of it and how they're like the antithesis of that culture. like they keep trying to do other stuff or if they keep trying to do other stuff they'll still Or like, they keep, like, Sadat just keeps doing other stuff, and then, you know, our actual president is just a bum. Even if her heart is in the right place She's not doing any of the right thing No seriously, (****) Probably as low as 2, no? He's also doing tennis, right? I don't know but he probably ignores this one anyways. Oh, then she very clearly has a favorite child. And it's 1 out of 15 and she ignores the rest of them",
    "Where were we Yes! Oh my gosh, how do you feel about that one? Like I didn't cry the first time around. Guardians of the Galaxy. Those are silly. They're so silly. I know. I love them. Oh! Have you seen the most recent one? Guaurdians...guardians of (***) I heard it's really sad. I haven't watched it. Like a lot of (***) basically I think I think you should watch it. I think you'll love it. I really want to...umm.. I watched Infinity War and Endgame and then I went back and watched the rest of them. like we're in the same boat basically we're in the same boat but i actually won back and watch like all the rest of them. because like low-key i watched a lot of them last year all the way to japan Um, on the plane, but they didn't have several I think civil war which is what i need it's what i was missing..(***) I watched those...but I have to The first one? The first Avenger. That's good, that's a good one. Have you seen my girl? She's an escalator. But um. After I watched all of them back, I came back to the VR and N-Gage. And I was like, wow, that really sucks because the timeline here is... So can I do spoilers? Yeah, so the timeline is that they.. Their group gets formed. And then, like, stuff happens. They fight people. And then they separate. And when they separate, the next movie... of them together of the Avengers is Affinity War? So... That's why they come back together to work as a team again. but in between that they're all getting like individual stuff done but they come back together as a team again, but then they literally just like fought. Like really really bad because it's like 2016 to 2019 I believe Or, no, 2018. No, 2018 was so ended. no no 2018 isn't. They (***) you are (***) 2026 So yeah, so basically for the last two years before Infinity War They've all been separated. And that's why the tension is so high. It's so sad because... They literally fought and then they come back together but only to save the world again And then right after that, they just go right back to arguing. They never go back to being friends. and then someone dies...or something...does someone I some of them leave...They literally just and I was like, yeah I was so sad I'm glad they ended it at endgame for the Avengers fans. I am glad they ended it. Uh...but I'm gonna miss it so bad..like Ahw! It was so cute. It was so good. star check? I didnt watch Star Wars. The only Star Wars movie I watched was where... Kylo Ren and Rey kiss at the end, and then... I was like, oh, aren't they siblings? And my dad was like, yeah, but it's Star Wars. Haaa...it is thats very (***) like...yeah...right Yeah! I don't know what it was, but I know it was another like... movie with the same name as like another movie from 20 years ago. (***) It was okay, I don't remember it at all. I remember the cinematography was pretty good. That's too much. Which means..Star wars? Oh! How many are there? 9? um... Haaaa I love Lego Star Wars games. Okay, so I'm gonna have some of that now. Ha...Haaa...What other ladies do that? Oh! wait wait (***) ok...Like to be fair some of them really good..yeah What is that? oh this is the one you were talking about and (***) Yeah no, I feel so like artificial Is it like comedy?",
    "Hmm...We're talking about Infinity War. Ohw! That was okay. I mean I didn't really cry because I didn't know half the characters. Ohw! actually, I watch... What was the space guys again? The Guardians of the Galaxy, I'm watch them. Oh, they're good. They're so funny. How's that? Ohw!!...No Ohw! I don't know...I don't know anything about it. wow Hm...hmmmm Alright.

I dont know...(***) Oh the other way never mind Aaam.... Haaa.haaaa...Ummm Ok I don't know Star Wars like... There's two trilogies, like book one through six. I think they're okay. They're good. Ah..like..1 through 6 cuz there's like the prequels and the actual trilogy Uh, there's like nine...Nine and one But I prefer the shows actually, they do a lot better than those. Like, the movies are a good fun though Haa haaa I watch just a lot of historical movies..(***) Um.... (***) two because it's the most popular genre of movie. They are... Um... You know...there is actually a live adaptation of a manga and anime. Its..It's called Uh...Golden Calamary. Yeah, it's the first movie adaptation I did it was so good The casting? 8. The setting? The storyline, they did such a good job. They were so good at it. Normally... like live action movies of animes or mangas FaceTalk. You're always so bad. But this one is like they like played up however Ridiculous it is but they also kept like some of the actual serious tone Animes and Mangas looks like a comedy.. With like serious circle tone What are they gonna do? She's just getting carried away. Weird? Weird!",

    "Robotics, right? We were talking in Hudson I guess Yes. Ashida probably knows about this and was trying to beat him. Even though last year we physically won. Alright, guys. So this year, let's make it a training year for all the new members that are coming in and the new leadership. and they said okay no but what if you went really hard and try to make it a world again I'm making a second team too, and that didn't... They should've just tried to relax. just get a hang of things but they tried to get immediately start doing stuff and then just Did not work out. But last year we won RAs. So it was a really bad idea when we tried to do every system simultaneously. So let's do separate, let's do important subsequence first. And they still say, alright guys, so love Kumar, go do a set. And it's like... Okay, yeah. Like I got the feeling when I saw kickoff that oh, there's lifting Guess who's doing that again for the third year straight? during kickoff when we saw the game reveal and I saw that there was a lifting thing. I was like, alright, I can guess who they're gonna make do lifting for the third year straight. Ah! Yes, me. Third year straight doing lifting. Okay. Guess why? Cause it's like I'm more experienced at the same time. Like. Bro, we were saying that we would focus on the important stuff first. Our intake wasn't even working by the time regionals came around, by the time we went to... Champs. Because...I don't know what the hell would even happen to fall out Haa! We went to regionals last year too. But it's still the same stage. Still the same number of teams. It's like slightly more impressive because there's more FGC teams every year. At the same time, Beast Box is gone from our league, so it doesn't really matter. No, Jeffrey's first year as president or as a captain. We only got to IOTs I think. Yeah, we only got top. We only got to the qualifiers. And then we got out there because there was no wild card in it, yeah. Like, it is impressive, definitely, but at the same time... The team is falling..so...falling apart so much. It's more just like that we lied really well during judging. And then Diya carrying ahhh...portfolios. Ahhh! And then half of the time when we progress, it's just all been off stage. Think, just a, it's literally just an engineering portfolio award. I'll tease, we only got the wild card because we got first team. We've had the best engineering portfolio from wildcard It was inspired that we got somehow, even though we're all depressed. I don't know how we got that because there are teams that are way more impressive. In every aspect, but I don't know, I guess they just liked us. And then ...ahhh...and then again Irene was like second stage Yes That's why they didn't want to give us Inspire. They didn't want to give us Inspire. Cause if they gave this fight to the 49th out of 49th or whatever team... Yes, per intake broke. And they spent like two weeks trying to fix that. Well, not they. Dia spent two weeks trying to fix it. I don't know what everyone else was trying to do...but like I don't know if it's still gonna be alive next year. Or not next, in two years. I keep forgetting you're in the same grade as them. No, I just don't think of your dream. (***) they give completely falling apart vibes and you gives Less falling apart. Yeah. It's fine if some people are good at academics, but like Some people just straight up do not have the brainpower to do more than that. And then they try and do more than that and they screw everything up. Also there's a small chance of just getting carried. What are the kinds of shichis getting carried around? Is it all individual stuff that she cooks on? No.",

Oh, you? Thanks! Wait you guys went pretty far this year? Haaan? You guys went pretty far this year, right? Oh! so but no, you guys had wildcard this year, but they didn't have wildcard last year. I see.. I see, I see. so... So..was it...so last year they made regionals. Did the year previously, did they qualify at all? So what? I see I see. Yeah, because there's nobody else working on it besides you. Because there's nobody else working on it besides you. Which has all been what? Oh my god! I see, I see. But then didn't you guys get like 49th out of 49 in? That's why what? Oh, Oh! I see That's odd. No, but that's crazy because you guys got Was it in Spiral Ward during Wild Card? Oh, I see, I see.

I have the remastered one right now, but I'm still figuring out how to play with it. Oh my god, I don't know these years. I was trying to figure out the order these games come in. But then it was modern warfare. Modern warfare won. And then two and then three and then there's like another one two three and then this is the remaster. And there's Black Ops, and then I found out, oh, Cold War is a part of the Black Ops series and then.. I'm like who's naming these and who's keeping track of these like this is awful. But i like it... Oh yeah, I know. I was like, zombies? Why do they- Every game has a zombies. Oh actually no World War 2 is my favorite game. It's actually really good. I like World War 2.

Yea and there is So he's my favorite character. Oh my god he got into a concentration camp and i was so sad. But no he got out, he's alive. I actually think it's not that bad. They show the horrors of it. The opening was so good. It was so good ok and... It's low-key they're not very on like oh it's like. Terrible terrible, but they're respectful enough that I think it's okay. Isn't no they're not being disrespectful or anything but.... Characters is racist but the main character acknowledges this guy has enough racism for... So hes mad. Bigotry actually.

But, um... The lore itself, I don't really care that much because it's a historical game. There's not- to it. Modern Warfare and those games I I think it's okay. The lore... I like the characters. But there's like some aspects to it that are like clearly very American politics. To US, And I think, I it is visible here and there Especially in sense. I don't know, I think it's really boring since they always go after like some Arab nation or like Russia And it's like I get it historically um. I can get the Russian part, but... May like go to war. Marcoon A macaron. A Macaroon?! It's Macarov Haha... Literally, But then um.... Uhh... It's like the four horsemen Like that, One of them is Russian .Two of them are like some Arab nation? I forgot.

Ok,My bad, right Oh my god, no way! No, my bad guys, my bad. But Haahaa Yeah, real, real, real.Ok my- I I think the main issue with me with a lot of these war games is They say that call of duty development it is not political But it's it's inherently political, right? We very much take a side. That's just US politics though. Yeah.... no,cause- Yeah because the thing is a lot of the characters in the modern warfare games are like war crime after war crime so it's strange No,But  the thing is  like, I don't mind, I don't mind when games get political. See if it's good commentary, but it's just like saying oh, we're not political Even though we are technically a war, it's a war game. so It's really (***) in the call.

But anyone can agree that crime is an instrument. The b- The b-b- people say it's not polititcal, They just say it's not trying to make a change within America. That's their point.

Why why that Big Fan Nerds? because there's only like four who took it last year. Only four people who took like AP Calculus. We are done. Ok. Do you do? Do they study AP Macro? AP Macro? Macro economics too. Yeah! Oh you'll find out. Yeah, wait cuz they'll be like oh Whoever is doing this AP exam come with me like during another AP exam And you all know who's like being weird, being nerds. Yeah, like if it's Exam right after they'll be like, oh Just stay in the gym guys, and they'll list out all the names. Then umm What else? How good (***) Ok ok Ok.",
    "Ha haaa.... Hmm hmmm So, there's, we have Kaishou, and then we have... show up and then I say. (***) Haah! Queso? It's queso? Yeah! Its quesco! What? Really? I thought it started with an R. Whoopsies. Umm Aaah? Oh yeah! right, well, I probably got something messed up. So. So, what do they mean? what do they mean? Hmm hmmm Hmm hmmm Yeah! something like that. I only remember the righteousness part. What is Haisho? Uhhh! I don't remember. Honestly I forgot everything about history. Uh! ever since the mock. because I didn't study that much before it because I had 5 tests that was required And then I have tests a few days before during that week. And then I have a midterm. in like a few days. Yeah English Oh! where its class is so bad. No, it is kind of bad. I do have friends in it. Yeah, it's fun, but she's a bad teacher.Haaa? Arranged seating? No. Yeah, we picked our own seats. We've been in those seats since the beginning of the school year. Ha ha haaa Oh! they're always yapping.... in my class. There's only one. There's like a bunch of smart kids, but the thing is they don't yap. They're like the... They (***) They're like really silent, but they only yap when like barrats like oh let's talk about this I do! I have everything to say! Laurence? Is it Laurence? There's a bunch of them and I don't remember who they are. I don't think it's Lawrence though. But Lauren Ohw! Aaahhhmmm There is two kids in my math class, who talk about A-Push. They're talking about how, they were talking about states versus uhm... federal rights, when...uh .. federal jurisdiction. when it comes to social security. Haaa...I know, right? Um, I don't know, because for VRAD we're talking about Social Security right now. I know, right? And they're having a whole giant debate about it. In math, like when we're putting away our Chromebooks, I can hear them still talking. They're still debating. They've been debating it for like 5-10 minutes. Uhm., it was like the last 10 minutes of class. I don't think she minds. Also, she likes them. She likes these smart kids. Because she'd always go on long tangents when one of them would ask a question and she spent like five minutes answering it. If it's about math, yeah. Because they're smart kids, right? They're all taking the AP course. They were taking uhm...AB BC and they'll talk, they'll ask questions about it...even though we're doing math analysis. So she'll talk about the AP class, she'll talk about the AP test itself when we're in pre-calc. And it takes up about 10 to 15 minutes of our class sometimes. through the entire class. She like, because about like a fourth of them are taking the AP test. in our class I think. I know, right? Hmm? Ummm...I don't think they're taking AP. They're probably doing AB this year, so I'll study it. And then they're gonna do BC next year, probably. I know right? Big nerds. Haaa? Ummm....I don't know actually. Honestly, they're they're nerds so maybe Wait, they do that? like? Ohw! Oh those weirdos. Uhm..Honestly, I think Barrett's class is one of the worst classes we have, actually. Uhm...See thing is ...I didn't like Bender, but the thing is, Bender taught and I just didn't get a title. (***) So I I haven't paid attention in any of her lessons since the beginning of the year. First week I realized I can't pay attention, so I stopped. And I still, I have good grades in my classes. Uhmmm....So I finished off with like a 94 last semester. Like, zero paying attention in her class.",
    "Oh my gosh. Wait, what's your favourite nation? What's your favorite nation? Oh my God! We see I...

Honestly, I don't know. I don't follow Genshin news anymore...like oh my gosh wait what the um like i love him so much Fontaine is actually one of my favorite nations because like after... They actually like upgraded...they upgraded their like cutscenes. Upgraded the cutscenes..and then because (***) It's so vid and they're so long and so much clicking and clicking and clicking. But Fontaine, I genuinely enjoyed learning about it. Like, he was actually fine, because Sumire was just, like, so much for walking, too. There's so much like unnecessary like...do..do...do... what? For now first move? It's the desert. It's the desert. And all the puzzles you need so much the actual maximum completion like the R&R class. like.. I'm not doing that. I have that a chunk of the VAP...like short side quest they said and then also the one in the museum And this is on like one of the islands, so when I was a little boy. Suri, Suri..and like Suri Yeah That one was like everyone was like, oh, it's so long, but it's so sad. It's so worth it guys I got halfway through it. It's like, I like it. Because like...I...I hate the ones where I don't... I am not...Like whenever I'm not like pampered like a little toddler and given the lack of exact location of where I need to go, I get so lost. I think so...May be They are nuts...ohhh! I will probably look don't use the word Does the mask do anything else or is it just for sentimental purposes? Ohhh!!! I don't know. Its like..I think I'm going to like..uninstall again because it's a 100th cake. (***) I don't have that space on my laptop. So I have to uninstall it again. Oh, it's a gaming laptop. But like...It's like five years old. I think it's like time because I used to run Zoom, Genshin, and Roblox. at the same time. So I'm gonna probably uninstall it so I have more room for other games That's not Marvel Rivals because the only two games that I can afford to have installed right now our Marlboro Rivals convention. No, I already understood (***) like oh I felt like a huge weight off my shoulders..I didn't I used to be...oh my god..I used to be, but I stopped crying and I just had it and stopped. With them At times...I just (***) I was like nervous I used to commit like hours and hours of (***) (***) whats on... No, there's quick plays, there's quick plays. It's cause you were playing in unrated, which is like the longer. It's just like...Its just basically a rigs game, but not rigs. It's just a long game. I know, you're still on level 3, I saw. You haven't logged in since we flashed. Did you what? Oh!!! I play. I play before I do my homework. It's so shameful. I'm so I'm so addicted. It's so bad. You are on twitter? I love how everyone still calls it Twitter even though it's gone now. Twitter is so cute. And silly. No, no, no, Twitter is so like cute and silly and then X is just like... X champ? Elon? He's like, oh! Haa haa X Bro, that's dumb. I haven't seen it. You just sent it to me. I love how people hate on Elon Musk's own app. It's so easy. Are we?",
    "So I guess you knew that. Uh? New Wave. UAE I really want to play but I told myself I wouldn't play until they added a character with Melania. And I'm like the most I have is like slate. So it's like in..ah! alright I have been following it. oh, her! okay yeah Yes Yes! I like going around and collecting all the checkpoints before actually starting the class.

I'm just sprinting for five minutes straight yeah like i'll pull out mona to go faster...pull over I saw you roll around the dunes. I still think it's such a long hike. I wanted to start R&R. I want to start R&Yaka. and i'm like huh short side quest yeah i'll just do this real quick Okay...Haa haa Wait which one? Is it the dueling one? Oh, it's true. Oh God Wait, wait, is that the one where you get the one sword? I like that one. Now...I will...I'm going to be like those people and I'm going to say that. They're nice. You should do them. Just do not use their mask. Do not use the mask or else you lose it forever. You get the recipe comes as a mask And the mask is like a sentiment, mental gift from like..the character that dies at the end. But if you use it, you lose the mask, just so you can get the recipe for that one sword. Unless you really need that sword do not use the mask It's literally just a recipe. Ha...Haaa Everybody laptop...ok I already saw Genshin, get rid of Genshin Haa,,,Haaa,,,,,Are you a Valorant addict too? I played like one game ever and then gave up on it. because I never wanted to commit like 45 minutes straight of my life to playing Valorant. Why would Ryuzo and Chihiro cause each round is like 10 minutes and they can just hop off? I'm still not level 10...why not? No, I logged in like two days. I logged in on Tuesday night because Jack Fu..asked me...told me to add him as a friend. And I had to log off to do mock. I added, I hopped on for like a second to add. jack foo as a friend and then i just didn't hop on again because i had to make more and then last night it crashed out the second I got home No, I'm worse because I just tap on Twitter. I don't even play Rivals. Then you all know..(***) Unfortunately. You already call it like zitter? Aaaa....Elon Musk, stupid job. Every time at the end of a speech, he'll jump and try to make the shape of an X. And that's why he looks really stupid whenever he jumps yes Must be crap...Yeah, he jumps and he's like does that He just looks rude I see random space (***) on Twitter, and I'm like, wow, that looks stupid as fuck.

No, but, but, feel the, uh, like the... Like the, what do you call it? the... progress like the development gradual development..Oh! Yeah. Okay..oh Yeah, but maybe he just likes lamb.

Yeah. and also the pokemon story i posted that At first like...I posted about TCGP first. Umm yeah he's a copycat Oh, and I'm like the alpha like you? So.. Haaa....Yeah, I definitely agree. Is that what you would do in that situation? Yeah, I wouldn't either. I don't think it's being presented.

Haaa haaa Love has no boundaries...ummm Oh, oh, oh, after this? What, what, what would I say hypothetically? I was thinking Cardi. Playboy Cardi has been kind of... Been edging a drop soon. So, and I know he likes Playboi Carti. I also indulge. and the fondness of Playboy Card here.

    "Wait, I don't understand why junior class is so like They're so college-minded like I don't understand andre Sahir?sahir sahir Really? i do I don't know, but you guys do a lot. A lot more than just seeing thousands. He does cry. dude ur lucky but I don't know. there's for senior class at least like there are a lot actually like A lot of people that hate their activities.

Wait, because she followed you last ohh I feel like it was pretty hard last time. Well, but I feel like she knows the concept better than I do. But like, she just goes on tension. Oh yeah. i didnt know (****) Well, they'll still get a 4 I think. Were you in it? No. Are you doing it this year? Wait, I don't know. I don't get why you would do it why not just do it ohh ohh Like do you just play games all day? You play games all day? Wait, I...",
    "So, I don't think it's that they're college minded. but that there's just a bunch of kids who are just a bunch of nerds. cause we have clean and flattered so many and then.. Who else..? and then we have.. We have a bunch of other players. Huh? Sahir? I don't remember if it was Sahir yeah Like, maximum, maybe. And then... Does Viva count? I don't think it counts he just referred i know they are doing it off umm Yeah, they're the only ones I really know they're doing. Like, they're substituting a bunch of AD classes, especially like... like mathhead (****) huh? ohh I don't know, people in our group just kind of know. its like we kinda know everybody kinda know (*****) Because they always like talking about it. They're like, oh, what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? I think I just like talking. Yeah, they just like talking on a show. No, I don't like her classes classes are so bad because all she really does is she has a bunch of slides Because you don't miss Perry, right? (****) but she actually points it And it's actually relevant to what she's teaching and what's on the test, right? But for Verrett... She does a bunch of slides, but then she just stopped. And there's no substance behind it. You're better off going on YouTube, searching up push videos and they'll explain it to you better and more succinctly. And it's more relevant to the actual AP test. Because she's making us do forever queues that are Ellie queues They don't follow the guidelines. like the AP test for US history. I think it's close. By the beginning of the year, a lot of the Didn't really follow the structure and what they want yeah it was strange and shes I'm also really bad at grading our essays. because like she's giving us mad scores but the thing is everybody always gets good scores She's too easy of a grazer, so... You could write the worst essay of your life and she'll still give you like a 27 out of 20. you No, it's so easy just to like write random stuff and it works out. We just had an L.A.Q. yesterday and I wrote the worst essay I have ever written. ever written in my life and I'm pretty sure she's gonna give me at least a 25. I feel like she knows the content but honestly from what I've heard about her for AP Art History, it makes me question whether or not she knows it. because she she knows like the names of art pieces but she'll horribly like butchered their names like she called them by something else Because she doesn't want to call them by their name. just like....  You have the art team. history teacher and history teacher in general? Should you know how to pronounce these things? Shouldn't you know how to correctly say these things given it's literally what you're teaching? it actually shows up on like the test They won't know what it is because you're using a different name for it. its really (*****) Yeah four , but everybody last year ap of history There are also They were basically saying, yeah, it's basically a self study class. And two weeks right before the AP test, all of them were fine. Because apparently half the stuff they needed to learn wasn't taught in class. Yeah, so all of them are like, oh, I need to self study all day. No, thank God. I was thinking of doing art history. But then after I saw, after I heard what my friends were saying about the class, I was like, Never mind. I don't know, because I think a lot of them actually wanted to do like They were actually interested in the material also. Not just for the credit, because I actually thought it would be an interesting class. But from what I've heard... the topics they teach are Interesting which is that barrette isn't good at teaching teaching it thats like she was the teacher Don't you? He plays Minecraft Front row seat, front row seat to the right, next to Verret. playing Minecraft Bed Wars. I see him playing Bed Wars all the time.",
    "Do you have any conspiracy theories about it yet? Like Catherine from? Adventures ago, how do you see these? There's so many of them. If you like stand by her and the AFK, like the voice line from the MPC's like little chat bubble. Yeah, and then also the keyhole in the back of her Thank you. Do you have any idea like, uhhh is about like this ohhh I like the theories, they're pretty fun. I mean Fontaine had like a ton of theories There's a bunch of there's like 6 to 8 word class that were actually linked together in a social network to give like a real piece of work. but right now with natalyn wait can i give you spoilers ? what? So basically you're doing that and that leg. There's like this entire tournament going on and then people are competing to go fight the abyss. and like a war and then like One of the characters that you meet when you die is a little 8 year old child. What's going on? and She dies? And then they're supposed to bring her back. That's like customary, right? But she doesn't come back, so they're like, what's going on? so then Honestly, that's as far as I've gotten so far, but I know at the end, one of the harbingers Like the guy with the weird mask and like, yeah So basically, he shows up to that one. It's canon, the Harbingers are capable of taking off their fur coats. They're capable of taking the Colt Top? Crazy, right? Okay, um, so they- sorry. so because and then they fight with the (***) At the end, I heard he dies. I don't know why. I haven't done the quest itself yet. umm yeah we are getting about to it Me, I speak to myself. Or like, you know how we were, like, high chat to, like, no one in particular? Like, chat what is... like that's literally me. ohh Yeah, no, that's like, that's weird slang. wait but like for genshin actually umm It's Sasha finishing this release in like 2020. ohh literally I started in 2020 and now it's 2025. That's so weird. Did you play Hawkeye before?did u play hawkeye? (****) in like  March of 2020. no,March of 2020 2021. that was my.. Because my friends likes it so she got me into it actually after i finished the icon quest in like one snap really really really really emotionally attached to it. so i didnt wanna finish the quest actually uk the end of each quest The Archons there, you can ask them questions about the lore. Like I didn't want to like to say like oh, there's no more questions (****) Who was your favorite character at the time?who was your favorite character? When you're like, when you're playing. Like, where do you pick the characters? oh did you see that costume? costume (***) the costume (***) It's so cute, isn't it? No, but it's so cute! It's actually so cute! but the outfits too (****) How much storage do you have? I have like 400 on my laptop, but 200 are taken up by some mystery thing. Consuming my storage genshin takes up so much storage idk how u sit with that",
    "so hahahah I've heard this theory. like every time and she would change all of them so it's like hmm I wonder. i No, she has the random line too. The one suspicious lie I remember well. Yeah. i dont know its been like.. The sky comes out really interesting but if there's no mountain I'm still not going back. Usually my style is just like, I don't look for, I don't theorize, I just see where the game goes. Like I'll read all the random theories But it's like, I think, wow, those are all like really interesting. I can't wait to see how his actions are printing out. And I'm like, I don't think any further. Sure, but make sure you yell them so everyone can hear. Make sure everyone at this table can hear the spoils. a potato? hahahah Who's we hahaha I don't do that, but I get what you're saying. So you're twitch streamer I thought, no, when I downloaded it in 2020, I was like, wow, it's going to take so long for it to end. and it's already 2025 I'm like okay five years three more years to go I literally pre-installed it. Like, I looked at the place and went, wow, this game seems interesting. I just had to pre-install it. no i was bored it's going to the place where we're covid so i was like wow this game looks pretty pretty interesting i just downloaded it You are the beta And then 2021. 2021. Cause at least August 2020. you I think I had the problem where after the first outcome class I did that like when I first downloaded it and then I stopped playing the game. I didn't start playing the game again until like February when my sister pulled me back in. I thought he was like finish all the course When the game came out. (****) I saw that, but I'm still not playing the game. It also costs money But there's still no melody in the game But it costs money! I totally think it's the same thing. I still have Genshin downloaded on my laptop and my PC at home, and I still update it. I just never unopen the game. I have an M2S steal at like 1 terabyte. And then I have a random Seagate hard drive I bought on Black Friday 2020 for like... you $60 and then it has like six terabytes or no four My laptop, it came with like a 512M.2 but then i also got an extra like one per my sd and then i just crammed it into the case and then it fit",
    "So i have not do you think it's a little bit weird if I just some random girl you met roughly a year ago who thought You were cute. Messaged you still and keeps trying. Honestly, me too but especially if he has Like... No other like girls or especially if he doesn't have a roster You know and he only he is like less than 150 followers Yeah. Bro he has a sunset profile picture, I don't think. umm What if he's like Oh, I don't really like her though, but then she doesn't want to block me so that's why he's like dry But what if it's because he doesn't want to be rude? Wait, me too. Me too. Wait, I... If I was him and if I didn't like myself... I would have blocked myself at this point, not gonna lie, because it's not like I'm gonna sleep. No, but that's such a bad mindset though, it's like Do you think it's weird that I keep making the first move? Really? Because there's no mutual moves, you know Scared. Would you be even more scared? W-O-R-O, yeah Okay, let's let's draft a message then so I wish lamp could just drop right now. So I'm like, oh jeez new live album they dropped in 2024 But that was the first time they dropped in like over a decade I think. Yeah, I don't think they're gonna drop anytime soon. No, but then don't you think i would sound like one of those guys that are like wow If you like Bruno Mars, name me two songs right now. You know what I mean? Have you ever met someone like that? I have. Oh, I mean, no I haven't. Thank you. yeah, No, what if what if lock in with me right what is He's posting it because he was like, oh this girl likes This artist may be some other girl. who he's plotting on will also like this artist.hmmm I don't think you're losing. Maybe you're a loser at heart, I think. Thank you. I know you're lying. Really? I know you mean I think amongst  everyone at this table Kumaar looks the most loser coded. He looks like he's destined to be in Shabol. hahaha Yeah Right? No, like sharing a bowl. That was like a whole loser outfit. Soul loser energy. but but during the glow up photo Um, you know, that was very not loser-toted, you know what I mean? you uh huh yeah totally not tricking at all I completely agree. And... I 100% agree with you. causee We're definitely soulmates in another universe. This would do.hmmhm I just need to keep applying pressure, huh? Yeah. uh huh",
    "So did you text him? I would be really flattered actually. If someone wanted me that bad, I would be so flattered. Exactly! So he probably feels the same way. Exactly, so that's like a new file. And you can post your cats. Exactly what I'm saying. So are you gonna text him? Well, then he wouldn't like respond to at all. But he does respond to you. If I didn't like someone and I was interested, I would leave them on read. Or delivered. I leave a bunch of people delivered. Exactly, he hasn't mocked you. It's the truth, like he hasn't blocked you. And he responds to your messages. That must mean he... hes like open to u u know Why would that be beer? What if he's like, you know how you're scared?

    "Good day, mate hahahaha why are u.. Dude what topic were we talking about? Wait, I enjoyed it i i've listened Yeah, she's an interesting person. no I never saw that. she's like oh my god wait i wanna okay Can you tell her to like show it? Wait, I'll tell her, I'll ask her to show it during season. okay Did they talk? What did they say? i only like has it been (****) it it even appropiate ? Wait, because last year she put like balloons everywhere in her classroom. Okay, but like I like the Jeopardy, I like the Kahoot! Wait, at the end of every unit we play Jeopardy. Maybe that was at the end, but like she would... I played a lot of games in her past. Yeah. That's so sad So like, she's doing it. (****) but like I don't know. I like the key terms. I think those are useful. . So weird. But I mean if you didn't use AI to take you like an hour Because you need to go through the textbook Yeah. It's all boring. I don't like it. ohh Yeah, it's not good. And then, wait, but like last year she made a form and she like... Do you even use a textbook?and i i If everyone was truthful, everyone would have put no. but like Wait, but I put the I put no but and then.. What else did she do last year? Do people even answer questions like the smart people do? That's not bad Wait, yeah. But like, none of them are interesting. Wait, cause... yeah but.. I thought she was depressed at the start because no one was answering her questions. What area? what? Also, this is a colonization. But I feel like hard to emcee is hard. (****) wait but like.. but like she pulled it very hard last year like if u didnt say.. yeah cause like  People would get like... it's like seven points yeah so people would get like 20s or 15s glasses sometimes (***) like the first one I knew I got like the 2015 (****) what? I think you guys just sucked. I think she sucked enough for you guys. but like Do you think you'll be screwed for the test? what? Oh it's digital. Wait, but that's way easier. what?",
    "What? Oh we were talking about how bad her class was. Really? You like her closet? Okay, she is interesting as a person. Did she ever bring out the Washington dolls? She has dolls. She has a Washington and a Thomas Jefferson doll. she brought it up when we were talking about the bonding fathers and she said yeah will you take off the her pants Washington has like dollar and like dollar pants and i think thomas jefferson has the american flag for underpants She said that if I ever have children I'm going to make a play with it. It's like about... this and they are move them around..It's like a Barbie doll washington and thomas jefferson they had also voice buttons  where they actually talk I don't remember what they said. Her birthday? I don't know. I don't keep track of the day and birthday. Well if it did, she didn't do that. What Jeopardy and Kahoo! But you beat Jeopardy and Cuckoo! No, she gives us a test. That's it No, she hasn't done that yet Honestly, all the people do is play games. When she's talking because I think it's nobody pays attention to her lessons Like I know a friend who actually got like the barons like book for a push and hahaha Yeah, and she's been taking notes on that instead. Basically, I don't pay attention to her lectures. I go to Heimlich's and I find notes online and I look at that. Yeah, the only thing useful about our class are the key terms. But the fact she's making it so you can use AI kind of like takes you there for a ride I think. you I'm not reading that textbook. At the beginning of the year, I was like, OK, I'm going to read it. and then I read a few pages and it's so long. It's so big. and so long and they jump around different times. I don't like it. I saw a bunch of reviews on it because I searched it up and said this is like one of the worst books. Not worse but it's not that good. hahaha wait u guys... (****) I think maybe you're probably one out of like five people who said no. (****) like We have like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 people at most. It's not bad, but that's it. Because they're either like kind of like annoying when they're talking Or they go on for like really long. Only one of them because one of them was my friend yeah No one was answering her questions actually. Only like two people I think. My friends are starting to answer her questions because they like the talk. They like this specific area of history. It was like after the Spanish-American War. Yeah, they really like the watermelon part MC's? If you study they're not hard at all. I think they're kind of easy. And you can also get away with barely for the FRQs as well. FRQs, LDQs, SAQs. They're all easy to get away with.like.. just like barely studying because you can just kind of like write whatever. 7 points but then  it's ummm5 points per 7. you. . Damn, really? 15 to 20 For the first one, I got like a 20. We're at like a 20-25. But the thing is, she led us all, like, she, for the next, for a few, she said, This one would have saved the last FRQ and everybody got like a 32 or a 35. Probably, but the thing is I don't think she's a better teacher It's just easier to pass now The AP or APUSH, the actual AP test. Oh, definitely. Everybody knows. Everybody talks about it. For the AP test? Yeah, we're all screwed. We haven't actually practiced writing a good essay. Because I think everybody by now has realized you can just write anything as long as it's Accurate yeah But no, the first three to four efforts you had, it was all him. So we already went through that.",

That's not your sound. wait they are like the way they are like.. changed the (***) kinda annoying but like.. thats like cause like  different traveler have different capabilities Like, Levine does more base attack damage, or like, either like... He like climbs stuff faster, he's better with his stamina. and then also like in other games similar to it they let you like change umm (****) No, of course not. Okay, but like, actually... My favorite character right now is... My favorite region is... This is so far back. like your first question for me was  my favourite region for the longest time as well but then i like.. and I'm absolutely in love with the nation now. (*****) 100 expolration Exploration out of all of yeah i have like really.. I guess that's the only nation I have 100% in one area. It's not the entire nation, but one of the sections.

Me neither. I got 100% and then I went back. i am back here while later I found another chest. so i was like It was a common gas. It was a common gas. Like, that was not a nice one Like the world, the world, the world hurts. those what? I never really knew that, actually. I always ignore the rules. i Drop the game whenn.. felt like a chore to log on every day. Because every day I would log on due to the four commissions. and then I'd log off and at that point I was like, I don't like the game anymore. i have 15 I'm at 58 Yeah, no, because when I was around the time I quit was the time that the first person got to AR60. Everyone's like oh my gosh it's the first AR60. So at the time, I was really high-ranked, but then like... umm i stopped playing for a while and then everyones ar60.. Yeah, no, like, everyone, like, even if it's like, a year and a half already at my level, and I was like, dang, you guys went fast There's so much more to do because for us, we were like at a standstill. nation with a nation there's only two or three at the time So then when you finish the Archon quest, the only thing you do is explore, and that's of like the most efficient way to get like exp. no no i  I feel like there should be manners for like, different like... differentv(*****) yeah but like she betters but one is  lowerl level card but other one is harder level card but u can be like a really high level and not have the story.",
    "So where were we again? Genshin Impact, very unplugged game. What was your favorite reason? All of them, including the Lunatic-Hype ones, like Goldeneye, Father,archipelago, Archipelago 2. I look every summer. I think every time I only start playing it until after all this stuff has ended. I can only open it in July We got a cousin. And it's so easy to get Why do you build pity on another banner? Just wait! You can't wait to go gambling. You don't need to go gambling immediately. You can wait to go gambling. okay I think I got him in like 10 pity after Hu Pao. I think my biggest regret over the years has still been... When I pre-installed, I didn't get Venti on his first map. I think I still have venti hahaha Thats just unfortunate. I think my first letter was Aether. yeah i think second one I don't remember my second one. I think it might have been like... Putao? Because it had a big gap. I quit during I think clear albedo. I didn't get out of them and when I rejoined, it was basically just True Talent. I think you got chow like the next banner after Wait, can you do it in Zenless or in StarRail? Number one in waves still isn't it? It's similar, but it still isnt way worse Even Monsta X? yeah which region though? The one with the little guy? The one that's in the valley? I don't know what it's called. huh I sometimes respond. Like even if you... even if you go through and clear all the like ultimate chests you can still go back like A week later, they'll respond. Okay, Lilz, respond even faster. See the main thing for uhh 100% is just the selkies and all the bigger chests. all the planets the storylines and stuff like that Do you know that sometimes there's also random challenges? Those too. yeah huh They're like Those also count, right? Like, just a rather common test will just, like, respond sometimes. I looked into it because I think there was a time where I was trying to 100%. All the reasons when I got bored and then I dropped the game And then more regions came out, and then I quit. But what AR are you at? Everybody and their mom is at like at least AR-55. i mean I think my least favorite part about the newer version is that... all the quests have such a low level requirement because what people pull Ugh, not one character. How am I supposed to get the materials for them, if I can't reach not one? you They should be like a level of requirement. Cause like the max level is still what, 90?",

Would you actually not take it? Because I would have taken it. Like genuinely. That's so funny! okay b. It's way too weird because We're from two completely sides, two completely different sides. of the state. of state But then, okay, let's say something were to happen. It's gonna be like... Like eat it and, you know? Be my discord kitten, yeah? Okay, but then, what if we don't? Worst case scenario, it's gonna be like, 8 years. Eight years, nothing. Yeah that's true. umm It would be very awkward. Because we go to different schools from different sides. is just not interesting. and Okay, so I was thinking That.. maybe , maybe Maybe oh, I forgot to say see you I don't even know if there's a seat. but No! I don't think that's necessary, but I don't know what to say Maybe once Cardi drops, I have music.  Oh. You know, fun fact about Playboi Carti. He has been saying this since last year, like late, late last year. He was like, guys, guys, I'm gonna drop a new album. And he kept saying, guys, it's gonna be soon. And then Kendrick Lamar dropped G and X. Like with no publicizing, no advertisement. Um so Cardi was like Oh shoot, Kendrick just dropped. So half my fanbase is like obsessed with Kendrick now. So he's been saved. Don't worry guys! Errm... I'm gonna drop a new year. He has no drugs, so maybe he's just not gonna drop the album. Yeah, yeah or if lamp drops a new album. Low-key though, I mean honestly though The messages, I mean not the messages, the notes. of the songs that he posts on his Instagram are actually really like They're pretty solid salt, I'm not gonna lie. right right Right, you're so right umm I agree. But still... yeah stop so umm' Okay, but I don't think like the best case scenario Okay, like what's the best case scenario, you know? Okay, okay, let's say best case scenario. Yay! It happens. Worst case scenario. Yeah, because that would be like the third time in a row. I know. Yeah, I was talking to Todd and he said oh he just forgot maybe But then when you realize you didn't send it, don't you send it anyway? i I agree. Yeah.umm I don't know what to say. ohh its ohhh she is in tracking field And it's track season right now Yeah, well I only knew that because I stopped. Eye music, yeah. uhuh Maybe not about Shag, that's like weird, I don't know anything about Shag. No, I don't want to lie to him. That's like, that's funny Yeah, okay. Well, I should ask. Oh wait, I already know what he does. He runs the 100 and 200 meters. That's legible. Maybe when it happens.",
    "i think u should just text him like Wait, why are you even scared? I genuinely don't understand why you're scared. Uh-huh. Wait, let me refute that. u dont know that.'How do you know he doesn't like you? He's responding to all your messages. He took that bread from you. I wouldn't take a bath, like a half idiot (***) no a loaf of bread. I wouldn't take it. But he did, so. Wait, I never said that. Okay, I might take it, but then I throw it away. But he literally sent a photo of him eating it. So... okay Love knows no bounds. Love has no boundaries. But what if like, what if in college you guys, you guys- you guys go to like the college and then you like Oh my god! but like it doesn't hurt to try like you don't have anyone a better priority Why? That's probably how some tosses are played. You guys both take Japanese 3. That's already one. You guys are in J-World. maybe Exactly, and I refuted your A and B, so there's nothing to be scared of. I'll text him for u Then text him. Okay, I'll hold you to it. That's mean it's soon. Exactly, so (***) I can feel it in my bones. And once that happens... u will be texting him because if its happen i am gonna text him Exactly so that's like all the more reason I sure hope you do. There's a lot of scenarios that are good though. Is that really that bad? What he's he's probably just not a message like like a lot of people I look You and I are like chronic message lockers, but other people aren't. wait that's true like i told you like sometimes i replied it in my head and i am like.. and then I don't actually reply what if he did that too and I didn't realize Yeah, but what if I don't realize? What if you didn't realize? Exactly. I'm gonna keep talking about Mitchell. ohh right. That makes you seem like a stalker If you post something about it, you can tell. So, I'm gonna hold you to it. carti drops The album or lamb chops an album or he posts about like track And you know I will. You can pretend you're in shock.

So she gets really mad at us. Hey, guys! Like One to two hour movies? Damn...! She like sucked out all the good parts. And she can build up bad parts for her like for us. Like we haven't even gone to World War 2 just yet. With we just finished ah The Great Depression. And so we are probably moving on. to World War II. I mean, I feel like people should know World War II. It's not hard. You should remember it from like Flores' class. religion oh like in like their earlier periods Yeah, there's like the second like great awakening and then there's like a bunch of them, like from the Protestants to like everyone else. Mm Yeah, probably, but honestly? ah. I don't know. And she's not that bad. They're actually like a lot of them, it's just like if you know what the history like the period is about then you can just kind of guess Yeah. Cuz, ah one of the MCQs, it was about the constitution and the amendment. And I had them all memorized, and it was really easy. Not all the amendments, but the ones important to the period, and like what the... challenges were with them and it was really easy for me. she's my highest grade right now. She's our worst teacher Hernandez really? Okay. I don't like her, but her class isn't bad. But I wish that I had Owen's style. Cuz, it sounds like O is a little easier on them. I also teachers bad girl What do you mean you want else to do? You want a, why? That's evil! That's No, she hasn't done that yet because most of that we haven't had like An MCQ, like MCQ. There have been times where there's like three in a row, but that's about it. oh she was like ha I got you mm mm So you know. I hear everybody in lane complaining about it Cuz, they have all MCQ, FRQ, and then have to do chapter quizzes. thing is ah for seminar, we do like A book we read it we take maybe like at most five quizzes about it And then we just wrote an essay about it. And... Yeah, we're already doing a whole paper Yeah. We have ah so there's like three parts to our game So, there's the there's our one part one task one, which is a group project where we each write an essay with different topics about the same, like different perspectives about the same topic. And then we do a group presentation. And then ahm after that we do an individual essay with an individual presentation. And then after that, we take the actual AP test, which is... us reading a bunch of papers.",

One choice, one answer choice. Like, for caustic, she made, she made one test all to that. She made one one test all D, so it was multiple choice all D. And then just has reversed that, no, right you Okay, but like I don't know. Because Carlson found out people were cheating. I think she did that as a curveball. Huh. So maybe Hernandez which is possible But, correct. Are you doing like or seminar. Well, as far as that's concerned, yeah ohhh Oh, next year you're gonna need to do a whole paper Oh really? mm",
    "hahuh hahuh That's it. ahh ahh.... cost I like their, then lovak current means people can get through the storyline faster and get to later regions. if they need the character materials from there but it's still like It kind of feels like it ruins the quality of the story because you will take less time going through the story. Yeah. Like it was already about grinding before like once you finish all the story but, yeah Like the whole reason people would need to get to the late regions that fast is just... yeah yeah mm? yeah Cuz you know how some events will have it where, okay, you need to complete this quest and be at this level. Maybe they could just do it like that for the banners. Or maybe they could do it like... None of the characters are limited, everyone is just like there's just a giant pool And pretty king high schools so No, but like you couldn't spend the money anyways, just ended up making him wait. ahw.. They've work to sake catch him I mean, do you remember the one, like, seven month, the, like... Two months touching banner when Meholy was having problems, so they had to move to Hoyoverse. I think it was like late 2021 or 2022. or they have or they were having like legal difficulties So they had to just run and catch you for sound. We were trying to get the stuff together. Ahh? I might have been mistaken. It might have been Ayaka. like that one long banner, pick yeah. Cuz they just had 102 days. Are you use 10 months? It was actually, I don't remember being 10 months though. I mean, my mom actually lasted like a long time. No. There was one where, like, it just straight up blocked it over the little pot. I think it was catchy. I think it was like COVID related legal difficulties or something. I couldn't even go outside or something. I don't know. I'm not sure. You know, either, let's talk about a different video game. How do you feel about StarRail? huh? You just buy mash ahw.. mhm I need a spidermash for that. No, cuz, my usually I main cooked out, right So like, a sad this My combos are like alright, so, Xingqiu normal. Xingqiu he, Xingqiu skill, ah Xingqiu wears were Jump to, who was my other? Diona? Yeah, I have Diona. for her shield and then Kaeya to ack to make the freeze last longer and switch off from though. I used to superneeded. I still need to do N1CD. Yeah. I'm singing all the way. Cuz, I tend, I thhink Before I quit, I told yova, so I was doing double hydel guitar but then I quit so I don't remember that one as well. Wait, who? ahw mhm No, I'm gonna be honest. Every time I went on Twitter for a while, I would see people, uh... like just crying over bullying ChiChi and I never pulled her. I still, I never pulled her like***",
    "Um.... So, wait, where were we? Oh my gosh, wait. Fontaine's of Audubon. Not am That's the thing, like now it's less about... Like it's, if we came in the more like have I'm it's more like crying Now even more than ever. yeah I remember like before because like it was easy to follow. Or maybe like instead of having banners like that, I feel like it's better like Each person gets their own individual banner or something? But that, that generates less money. That Generates less money, if you do that So like my idea was like when you start the quest. You get all the you get the banners for the characters in that nation But I don't know how that works, like maybe you speak through the glass in like two days, you know what I mean? But maybe like, maybe it's unlockable, like you said, like the level requirement instead of doing level requirements. It is like you have to complete At least the first part ah you have to complete the last Archon, Archon's storyline. In orders to unlock the characters for the next nation No, but then the Mexican, they didn't have enough money though, the point of *** banners is Generate the *** No, they spent more money when it started. It was everyone's pull together and everyone's there at the same time, then you can take your time to be free to play and just keep grinding, right? but if they give you a time limit, the more and more we'll spend money. Serious No, but what?Maybe what if it's like no, but and like If you got this standard banner, you get a character that's like 25 each words I don't regret it. I love my *** I only remember our like 300, like 1,300 day Ayaka banner. They're like 300 day Ayaka banner I am, yeah, I am. Yeah, 300. It goes like that. No, no, no. It was like the mentor number on the banner side like a really long time but it didn't actually last that long. It didn't no, it didn't actually last that long. It was just the number was really high. And then they lowered it once they were ready to end the bet. ***I don't know. oh... I'm not sure about that one, I don't know. I'm not a fan of turn-based combat. I like- I like gunship because I can just butt bash. And it works. I like Genshin because I can button match and it works. No, I I I have the keyword, right? So I just spam my skill because I have Navi on. So Navia is basically her the way she works, her elemental side. and all of her stuff is based off of attack. And then you... When you get like crystallized shields, the more shields you have. I think it's up to 6. Um..The more shields you have, the more damage you do with your skill. so it increases the base value and because the base value is increased if you do ***Just on the skill Oh, she sells herself out to power creep. It's like over. PPPPPPP no... Wow that's so like really good. I just need to do That's such an early tension like simcard That's ohhh! I didn't. I didn't do Cuz I didn't pray to her***And then I had CCIMCbecause she was a good healer and I likes healing CC I have a really like she's not like Oh she's in her 20k care, but like you know how like when you use her skin When you like hit there's when you're like attacking something which is a acting It feels like paradise.

    "What's that big sigh for? You should talk about, what? What came up as your science for? Like muh Unipop popcorn in the microwave? dream.. Why is it such a skillet? I can make pancakes. I can make pancake mix. He's my second period and I don't I don't do anything in his class Yeah, I don't pay attention. yeah Ah well, I'll ask him tomorrow. Yeah, and then, right It may be*** I wouldn't snitch. No one will snitch in my my class. Guys are, guys are just added in class Oh, no, because like in my my physics class, we play poker. He has Pocahontas. Yeah, he has that the whole set. And he gives a poker poker chest when he notices we're playing. Is it the best at poker? Um, it depends. I just bet whenever I can. But initially it's *** Huh? Yeah. It's okay What do you mean crash ahw I don't ditch class, I just don't pay attention And I did decent on this test, so it's not a big deal. No, It is all, See if I had like a market I would do anything else. But it's sad. So, I don't think. I don't think there's a pair of you that's crazy physics. Oh yeah, maybe I shouldn't do I shouldn't do AP Physics. Yeah, okay. But, but I don't think I'm gonna die I don't want to kill myself like Uhm? PC no? cuz The thing is um, I'm going to do, I'm going to do AB, right? and then If I really want to, I can just go further in college if I want to do math. Right?, so AB And then I'm gonna do J4 because I have AP resource Right? And then I have, what's my other AP's? um.. AP pair, so that's what we use AP. Why do you want to do more? If I do Japanese I'll have 4AP's you mmm.... Yeah, no, I'm good. It's a little bit more than that. We actually have to do a whole study by ourselves. Like, yeah.. It's a study. We do our own study. We have a thesis. And then we go out, figure out what our result is. and then we write a paper about it. It is actually a research class. Research? No, it's not. It's it's probably harder than seminar. Because for seminar, all you have to do is look at other people's research. and then write like an analysis of it um and then come to like a conclusion. But for research, you actually had to do research like, You're the one conducting a research experiment. huh? You have luck sure, it's like they got a teacher they have to do, like staff. huh? I want to do research next year. I don't know. Because um, it's probably similar to similar to seminar. but just more in depth. Just Who wants to look down haha and look at your credit card? Okay. so, huh huh Huh huh huh huh So research I think is probably harder than seminar, and Yeah. May be why? We're doing a whole research experiment! There is an exam! There's probably an exam! I don't know. It's an AP class. This is most likely an AP test. Oh true. No, oh, So for any research, they're probably going to make us do A a presentation, a report, and then we're going to answer a bunch of their questions. No, I'm not going to do come science Not big questions. They'll probably ask an specific questions. Like, it's a live questionnaire. It's like, they were they were recording you. It's a same-paper seminar. Um where after our presentation we start and they ask us questions and it's like",
    "Haaaa... Do you cook do you cook in this prescience class? What should I talk about? Yeah No. You just try the king To bring You should ask him for his his electric skillet and then you can...

So, You can you can make pancakes, you can make bacon, Maggi And you can say, I heard from... the previous years. He said he said, he said, he banned it because Dr. Stompers found out or something. yeah But.. We also brought a rice cooker. Let me make Huhu, Yeah, we, and then we, brought egg Ohh... oh mhm huhhahaha huhuh Who's the best at Poki? You still have that? still deal it? Thanks never crashed as per we have it So was the people? crashes people like, they will judgeing *** yeah, okay I cannot do AP physics. whereas ohh Wait, but I I had something to do yesterday. I got a B+. Wait, no, it's because of my missing, sorry. It's because of my missing. I'm sorry So it's possible. It's kind a It I has an A+ group. So, it's kind of possible. I cannot take PC though Can I take PC? Right. yeah yeah mmm Wait, but AP... have this is like a normal math test. Except yeah, we bring *** Huh, and huh, I mean research is just a bit of paper know. Ours ourself? But what do you learn then? Isn't it just a free period? I don't know. But but the entire the entire class it's research cycle Is it research time or do you have like lectures? I have gonna do that. what? Where are you going to do research? What are you going to do? research a? But like, why why can't do research? Keep going, keep going.. ss Keep going, keep going Why? why? huhu, Wait, stop. But there's no exam though right? There's no exam. Why? wait what? Are you annoyed?

    "So where were we? Characters, characters. yeah, yeah, yeah aahm Maybe like one, four stars. I'm a free-to-play person. We are.. huh? No, the only skin I have... It's like, anytime I have skins in any games, it's because my friend pays for it. we all have the free ones but if i have like a bad skin it's probably because of a birthday gift or something Ah The first one I got was the birthday one. No, no, no. no, the Barbara, the skin, the costume. um, From the Archipelago. I only rolled a weapon banner for Xiao's weapon and I got it in 30 so it was okay. See ya. Yeah, so basically on his first rerun, um, I Roll for him? I had like a lot saved up. I was like I had like 10, 11k saved up for him and I got him and 30 pulls and I had a lot of extra so I just went for his weapon and I got it, I got it. so i was so lucky it was the most insane Blank balls I've ever gotten ever. We had the best ones ever, like, it was really cool. I can't hear you. Oh, I want to see one for her first Constellation. ahw.. ohh...! Yeah, no, I know what you mean. It's her, It's because like during her skill like you kind of like dash forward. So there's no charge oh well, that's so good oh ohhh.. Ohh...okay, I see, I see. Wait, how do you feel like what's your favorite character? From Monsta then. from Monsta Or for each nation each nation. Um, Design, play style, lore. Well yeah, I have gone you though so like anchor And then they they got like rejected. They got sent back. No, literally like the developers were the developers were like There's going to be people trying to get across the ocean. They know, huhuhuhu at least like cut them off halfway before letting them spend like five hours of their lives They really they did it for hours and like you can even like an AFK for it because you just have to keep going forward. they really... it's, huh? Ohhh..... what's that? um.... I'm gonna To be honest, I did not like Bunty at first. I didn't like Bunty at first. Like I thought he was annoying. Venti. Um...I do really like... Yeah, like Kaya for the ice cream. Or like... I do not like to lose. You know like his outfit is so much better because it fixes like the wrong things about whatever is going on with him. But like his regular default, he just has like a really really big forehead. He has a really scrunched up face. Yeah, it's been a while. Like a long time, like years. It's like the first five-star costume to come out. No, it's like no like there's five, there's there's five stars you have costumes But then the costume itself is like a purple well the costume itself for dealing is because it changes um, it's a gold one when it changes It's your skill and your elemental powers. Yeah, first, it actually changes the color of his fire basically. I don't think so. It's gonna take a while. There's only like two so far. I forgot the other one. Um, Yeah, probably not. I... I got this serious um, I felt like it's moving too much towards like Like a modern feeling? Cause the purpose of it? at the beginning was more like fantasy, right? And then now like...",
    "So where were we? Good question. ahhh... How many characters do you have seizures? Oh, yeah, no, I am too. I haven't willed on a single game. I'm broke. I knew he was trying to get me to pay for the skin. Do you pay for skins? Have this three amber and bonus skill I'm so hap happy that I somehow have staph coma and C1 hooked out. The first five star muffin. ahw Oh yeah. Do you ever roll on the weapon banners? Wait for who's weapon? Oh the Jade Sphere What the hell? ah I ..... ***I'm just gotta pulls you to Oh yeah, you guys have been like really good at like all of those genres. I'm just glad I pulled ah C1 Putao and Staff of Home across different banners. But C1 is just that you can cancel this the... The charge attack so you don't need to wait for the full animation So then it's like faster cycling and you can get more taxed out. You do not understand, do you understand what I'm saying?. Okay. yeah Huh? No, it's there, it's stand, there's no like and where you're waiting for the animation to finish. Look it just, you can, or no. Instead of having to sprint to cancel, you can just jump to cancel. Like sprinting uses up stamina, so the, so the stamina goes up twice as fast So... So instead he can just jump, and it's basically zero sound, no? Wait, from mom? From Mondstadt? As far as my style? ahhh I'm drawing blanks on half the characters because I didn't...like Kai's ice bridge is funny. I don't Okay... okay... Okay, but which one can you but which one were people using for like Six hours straight to get tickets to Zuma before they had to ship. Huh huh, Storms head. No, they're like basically a dentist's offices. No, Huh. They are and then they aren't getting through, it was sweet They could have just cut them off like thorm like 10 minutes in the way would Our own *** Yeah, Like you can't just like, you can't just like set up a macro file there, because sometimes it'll just get shifted around. Oh, thank the Lord. It's like um Wait, who's your favorite character from each region? Ahh? Wait, who? Ohh.. New space. Oh wait they made a new costume for him? No Oh well. So like literally changes everything it's not just aesthetic While they get rolling out to like all the old five stars. It was just beautiful. Wait, who? Business deal, Okay. Jean, Mona. ahan",

    "okay rip you want to play do you have anything hahhhh ohhh Wait, Tegan would fit you very well. sshhh (***) Yeah. oh yeah Yeah, I would see that. yeah. heeee yeah it is (***)yeah yeah I don't really know too. I feel like... I feel like it's hard. yeah mm I feel like Taegon is like master student or like senior student. I don't know in my head like Everyone that I know that play Tigon is all like Like in their last couple years of college. Yeah, I don't think I've seen high schoolers play taekwondo. Maybe we grew up in... Very different levels. oh yeah me I feel like well cuz one I'm doing the izai 3 right yeah but i also yeah yeah yeah I want to learn... I eventually want to learn six. Really? ha I feel like six fits him It's very, like, fiery. yeah Do you have other things? yeah huh ha oh yeah That would be fun. Yeah. It sounds fun. Yeah yeah yeah. (***) Yeah, it's like the very flashy.  It's very cool. I don't think you should pitch the idea. oh Really mmmm yeah I think you can... like mention it here and there but like last year I didn't really have a choice sshhh ohhh Yeah, okay huhh But but if you're with Barney, sometimes he's a little more like me. I see. I think. Because like the Prokofiev concerto? Like i (***) It was just like Farty being like, oh, you should start this. Just get the music and start it and then I'll see you next week kind of thing That's what I did with her. I didn't really talk with Pugosi after. I think she found out after a couple weeks. like after my first two weeks of learning it with Barney. So I think yeah Mmm sshhh mmmm Yeah, yeah. Oh ohhhh Mmmm Huhhhhhhh Okay, well, (***) yeah  it's a very lyrical  yeah yeah That's what I did too. She knows but like last year I didn't do any Concerto. no park it was all lyrical and technique And then the last like 2-3 weeks it was like, oh you should do the percoflate first. But I feel like They'll probably let you start having a say a little earlier since Yeah, masters yeah thats all",
    "huhummm Aaaan ohhhh I think like the piece that my teacher assigned me humm Do you know Cha-Sung's poem? oh yeah yeah yeah she recommended that and then i think also like to go on would be..Yeah? Yeah? ssshh... Hmmm Haaa... It is. Oh, really? yes Yes, yes. Aaahan I feel like if you're like at a certain level... that's when you play that's what my teacher told me Cuz like everyone plays it in France, but like barely anyone plays at least Chanson, like Tigon more often, but yeah. mmmm oh Really? I think I've only seen high schoolers. Haaa...But they were like there you go they went to like Julliard Columbia so they're like also you know those kind of yeah yeah What about you? Yeah Oh!..hoo..haa yeah Uh-oh. We were talking about that too. Yeah, yeah. ha uhhhhh When you ask, I learned this. I learned my lesson, but don't directly ask. like what do you think like you should ask like how much time do you think it would like take for me to like reach this piece that I want to play so it's like he feels like He's controlling the conversation and the input, rather than like, it's just you. Yeah, he doesn't like when you discuss with other people before coming to him. Yeah, cuz that's mmm yeah yeah yeah yeah sshhhh Jihyo's like pretty open with like whatever. She's like way more open, but I think unless it's like For example, like me jumping to Brahms right now, obviously it's like, I know. But like, other than that, she's like really (***) good. They have to like discuss, they have to like get together in order for me to start something. mmmmm mam Yeah, yeah. ohhhh hahaaaaa yeah I feel like...masters, you're like a master student too. I feel like they would let you have more input. haa",
    "sshhh, ok huhhh Ah, yeah, yeah. I said it was good. Oh, I'm saying it's good. oh What are you guys thinking next quarter? I've asked this like four times.(***) I think you could. what did you(***) Oh, so you need three quarters of writer? (***) my (***) writer BL? Should I try for BL? I don't think I can get it. I can do both, right? yeah. i don't know do you think i can't like can i do second pass or no I want to yeah. what I'm thinking but I feel like the first one I'm going to take it in the first class. yeah That's what did not happen (***) You don't drop it either like for easy is not (***) Cam, in general, (***) Oh, yeah. Yeah, also like they go like mmm yeah yeah David? Oh, David took a break? Yeah, David took a break. Because he would do A and B. When did he do A and B? ohhh so we did C and now he's doing D okay.Yeah, I heard. Really? It was that bad? (***) David (***) Yeah, I think she dropped the camera already. She might withdraw. Yeah, I think she's she's Her mom is making her wait till today so I think she's dropping it though. She's like overwhelmed. yeah She dropped 14-D, like, she walked into the midterm. (***)she dropped her glitter. But like, will that affect your housing for next year? You already (***) for housing, yeah(***) oh Yes, (***) Is it called dropping or is it withdrawing? I guess it's the same thing. Ahh Yeah. Yeah, she dropped 14D like, To withdraw? I guess her mom wants her to think it through more. yeah i think I think so. I think it's only like one quarter long and she has like scope and she has a lot. Like EMT? Maybe. I don't think so. I don't think she can handle that. I mean, I don't know. Yeah yeah I don't think so. I think she's going through a lot. I'm not sure. but (***) why would they drop david dropped it too it was not bad Anderson is that bad? 14D. This was Anderson. No, no, Anderson. Fam is good. I heard Fam is good. you did? for d you finished already yeah i don't know wait hahhhh You did 14D last quarter? Yes! Oh! what do you mean? I'm not a memorizing person Well, that's a good thing. oh Does she feel like she has to? Well, yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's not like a mind test. I think she's just like, oh, I'm not good at this. ha ummm I mean, I guess not. At that point, she's like, I'm gonna retake it. I thought it was, someone told me it's not a prereq, it's recommended. Do you need 14C? As a prereq, not a co-req? Do we stop it?",
    "about your trike and... all-star all-star I thought it was really good. I thought the track sounded really good. Yeah Thus Like what? then Okay, mmm no, you're right you're right huhuuu yeah yeah But you want to do corn gold, right? huhuu  She hasn't asked yet. but Yeah, it's kind of scary. yeah yeah haa yeah ahhh Yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes. haahuuuuu ohhhh yeah Mmm yeah Yeah. yeah Yeah, I only did Like, I think I only started the third movie in like spring of Sinsong, so... Like, I only completed it now. yeah yeah sshhhhh It is, yeah. Yeah, he doesn't easily say what he thinks. yeah, yeah But it doesn't help. huhhuuuu with him I feel like I picked up Beethoven really quickly. Cuz I also finished like I have brought Beethoven seven like only the first movement And I was like done in like two weeks. I think I just do Beethoven easier. yeah you ah shhhhh huuuu I don't know (***)",
    "huhuuu So like she wanted me to like work on my technique first. So she was like, if you can get the technique done, then you're going to sound so much better. So don't and do it next year. I wanna at least try. And then like, yeah, that's what happened. She didn't want me to do it. yeah thank you thank you but hahhh haaa Did they like suggest all the pieces to you? ohhh mmmmm Mmmm she said no Oh, you haven't asked? Mmmm oh really Wait, so like how fast do you go through pieces? Like how long does it take you guys to like we (***) one piece I meant like, with the teacher. Like, when are you done having lessons? on that piece because it's taking me a long time Like, to get through all these pieces right now. And I just don't know if they expect me to do more or like... So we switch teachers, right? So I do Korngold with Bardi. But then, since I've been taking lessons with Pagosian, I've been doing Beethoven IV. I don't know, I just feel like we're never getting through the first movement. well today I finished it but like He was also mad that I didn't bring a piano yesterday. We're just not making any progress besides my sub chicks Yeah I see. Okay, that makes me feel a little better. Mmm okay okay That makes me feel better because I can't tell if he's like really manner me for not making any progress okay (***) Mmmm Mmm huhuuu huhuuu haaaa huhuu",
    "Okay, we were talking about... Oh, yeah. yeah ahh huhmmmm Yeah I thought it was good too. I guess yeah, it's kind of funky (***) sometimes (***) I feel like they just don't say it directly sometimes. Like the things that I want to hear directly, they don't really sound good. oh like (***) They don't really say exactly what you're lacking. They do say what you're lacking. But then it's like when they say no to a piece. They don't really say why. like (***) Last year I didn't get to play any concerto showpiece, any like double stoppie, like a little flashy, like None of that, it was all like lyrical, slow movements kind of stuff. So I don't know. Yeah, I said like even if I brought it up they would suggest oh, yeah family last year, and then i think, the end of spring quarter they like ask me what I want. But yeah, for the most part last year I didn't have a sting. And I She knows, but like, I didn't really enjoy some of them. Or like, I didn't really like some of them, but... I didn't really have a choice, so I just had to do it. Yeah. like don't  want to do corn balls. i didn't,  I don't know. I don't know if I'll ask. Maybe I'll ask him. I think it's a little too early. Maybe if I start... Maybe if I start... get to the third movement of the prokofiev maybe i'll like maybe pitch in the idea Yeah, cuz like last year I brought, I think I brought trike. first movement and then like bop to her And then it was like the first lesson with her and then she was like Yeah, let's do something else that's not the chain. Yeah.

Wait, what did you bring to her? The corn mold? yeah hummmm oh mmmm I feel like yeah last year it was like barely a piece a quarter like Yeah, I think I worked on the Tchaikovsky meditation for like a whole quarter. and then We also had the Vivaldi and the Vivaldi was like We had to do it in five weeks. After that, I started the Prokofiev Five Melodies. and I had it until the end of spring semester. last year i think i only did (***) I feel like that's just how... It's hard to tell.

He like tries to like go around yeah fun ike, what am I lacking? i think i think like Did you do the Beethoven with him? (***) Yeah, i feel like (***) Maybe that's yeah yeah I remember, like, with the Prokofiev, he was always like, okay. I'll see this next week again and it was just like that for like a quarter and a half",
    "okay yes mmm ohh Lately, what's bad about it? ohhh Mmm MMmm Yeah, we just said Finn was good.  Oh, okay, okay. you Finn yeah And I'm really good I explaining the concept, which is obviously the main part. But she doesn't do many examples in class. The exams are similar to the homework, but he doesn't. Yeah, so the hallmark's where you get the exact spotlight. Applying it you have to kind of learn on your own. Ruben But I don't think he teaches regularly. You don't have to worry about him. okay mam yeah oh Wait my friend at UC San Diego told me that they use iCooker remotes. yeah physical remotes and they cost like 40 yeah No, no, no like yourself has to buy this $50. I click a remote this big yeah it's not an app its (***) yeah I guess, but I also think they just have an old system. at that point its (***) location Exactly, and they have to pay, it's like 50 bucks. i know KATHRYN Taking a look at your forecast tonight... Yeah. I don't know  Yes. yes oka But unless you memorize the reactions, you don't know what could happen. you know i mean mmm mm I think it's both. Yeah, its like Part of the exam for us was like arrow pushing, right? yeah so that's conceptual like knowing how it moves but like for like the ones where you like fill in what the react or the product is, that's mainly memorization. knowing like what happens before and after. mm (***) I think she's comp bio. (***) Yeah, yeah, but she still has to do the LS core stuff so and she is (***) I think she likes math more. (***) (***) has pretty cool like concentrations you can do early yeah there's a bioinformatics (*** ) and like I forgot the other ones, but... Like, all, I feel like the rest of them were like, sci majors. You don't really get a concentration. It's kind of broad. Do they? Oh, for real? Okay. It's just my major. Okay. yeah huhuu does biochem have concentration? Mmm",
    "So we're talking about, like, 14D. (***) I am Okay, I know someone who took her. And she said that she feels like her teaching style just isn't effective for her.

My professor was hospitalized during time. my professor was hospitalization that time Oh, she adds a substitute chord to the rest of the chord.

She's very, like, fidgety. And so when you're watching someone... Talk like that, like, yeah.

I know! yeah yeah Yeah, I don't know why. yeah That's crazy. I was gonna say Anjali's memorization thing. Yeah. On the first day of class, Dr. Oh said to us, he was like, A lot of people say OCamp is memorization. but I don't think it's memorization, it's pattern recognition. And I think that makes more sense because I don't memorize reactions, you know? I look at it and I'm like, oh, this could happen, this could happen. You know? I mean, yeah, but it's not so much like... flashcards like memorized yeah it's not like  you just know like oh It's not like memorizing charts. Yeah. yeah like this attacks this (***) rectangle (***) (***) The aero pushing. i mean that aero pushing (***) Yeah Yeah.

(***) oh really I've been hearing from Alyssa that he didn't talk to her. chamber. Yeah. Like rehearsals too? and Like during orchestra, I was classroom master in the last cycle, right? So I have to be the one like telling him to move? Because I cannot believe that he came just for the concert. And then he stopped at Nathan's seat, right?

    "What were we talking about? no yeah consider i (***) most (***) genuinely consider  (***) oh and i was like yeah so actually he hasn't been showing up to orchestra Uh oh. He was like, it's not just studio. And I was like, yeah, it's not just studio. And then he progresses and goes like, do you know if he's showing up? I think Nathan or something I'm pretty sure he oh she was saying stuff like about how he was not showing up. I know a couple people in the same class as him and I'm pretty sure like she doesn't go And then you would listen was like This is like a serious issue like Like he genuinely thought it was a health issue. Because he just kept saying doctors, ER, doctors. And then I was like, yeah, um, he just hasn't been coming, and then We had a three-way conversation. where jaeson and him (***) like (***) Yeah, I know. Yeah, I don't know. That's a good question. i don't know how he would pass orchestra he missed like missed technically  yeah like how would you guys I don't know how I forget but like I don't know and like he was he was g-young student before here so like they have to like mother He was a g-young student. something like that. yeah Yes, yes, yes.

I thought he was gonna switch it off. like I guess there's nothing he can switch out to. data of science or date of theory i don't lknow you but i think so too (***)  Have you encountered him? Have you encountered a wild Jason? sshhh And he's watching videos. Yeah. that's why And that's why he doesn't show up to orchestra and studio. Yeah I was watching videos in the practice room and there was no ID card and it was like one of those rooms where you can like there's a wall to hide behind. you know like one of the bigger ones there so then i was like oh this is(***)I didn't see a backpack or an instrument. Open it and then the moment I went in I turned around And I saw Jason and I was like, oh, sorry. And I was like, oh, sorry?

Y'all are very interested in him yeah I feel like you would do the G.K.L. one day. Yeah I feel like I could see you doing it. You know You know how north wait i forget which school it is but they do like the marriage pact Certain colleges do a marriage patch where like They'll make all the, if they want to do it, all the undergraduate students fill out a form. About what they want in their life like future partner and then you get matched with someone randomly at your campus. Yeah, I forgive but like yeah Apparently they do that at some schools. Oh. (***) Or maybe it's something like that. Oh, no, it's UW. My friend did it at UW. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um... I don't think she did it because she has a boyfriend.  Sorry. a man like I think she told me about her friends. yeah Because I feel like oh no no no no no wait. It's the other friend. I was with Not UW, it was North... the better one northwest northwest sorry it's one of the north The purple one. Yeah, she was telling us that like he seemed like He wouldn't respond to her email cuz like The contact information that they give you is only the email address. well Because they get matched about what they answered in the questionnaire. I think so, yeah. yes I think so, yeah. It's the girl that transferred out of UCLA. The girl I just told you about. The north, eastern, western bastard. yeah, She's like i Okay, she's kind of strange She's like a creative writing and journalist type major girl. Yeah, she like (***) transferring or maybe she's just really indecisive but like in high school She started at my high school and then she started at Portola. and then went there for two years and then came to uni for her third year and then Went back to Portola as family, yeah. i Think she kept transferring it cuz like The high schools in our district have different like requirements like oh like your second year you can only take these classes you know and I think she wanted to like schedule her classes around like Certain like a peeling or like a (***) (***) i don't know But like she's saying how she's gonna do transfer apps again this year.

She's saying she's doing transfer if she wants to go back to LA She still has like couldn't get into, so she says she's gonna keep applying until she can't apply anymore. she (***) yes that's what i'm saying she's a little strange so i think she's applying to like columbia again like other one I don't know, maybe she was like, maybe I don't like Northwestern, so I'll apply back to UCLA just in case. And like since she's like a creative writing like person the essays are just like creative writing but like maybe a bit more pressure So it's just easy for her, I guess. I don't know, that's why I said she's weird. I feel like that hurts you more than... yeah I think she wants to be more of like an author. she like released a book before. oh no i mean she's just like a minor author you know you Well, she's kicking  Yeah. She said oh my god, she told me like my stairs. Yeah You know how like Jocelyn always asks for Instagrams at parties? At Northwestern it's LinkedIn. It's so normal for someone to just come up to you and ask for your LinkedIn. Like that's the first start of the conversation. (***)  northwestern Right? Isn't that crazy?
